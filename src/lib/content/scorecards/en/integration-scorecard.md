# The Integration Scorecard
## Your Six-Domain Assessment Tool

*Turn insight into measurement. Track the transition from fragmentation to integration.*

## How to Use This Tool

This scorecard transforms the Project Janus framework from theory into practice. Whether you're a mayor assessing your city, a CEO evaluating your company, a parent examining your family, or an individual tracking personal integration, this tool provides a baseline and progress marker.

**Instructions:**

1. **Choose your scope:** Individual, Family, Team, Organization, or City/Community
2. **Score each domain** on a scale of 1-10 (see criteria below)
3. **Calculate your Integration Index** (average across all six domains)
4. **Identify your weakest domain** (this is where integration is failing)
5. **Date your assessment** and store it
6. **Reassess in 90 days, 1 year, and 2030**

**Scoring Guide:**
- **1-3:** Crisis/Extraction - This domain is actively degrading the system
- **4-6:** Surviving/Compensating - This domain is maintained but not thriving
- **7-8:** Functioning/Developing - This domain supports integration
- **9-10:** Flourishing/Generative - This domain enables growth in other domains

## Interpreting Your Results

### Integration Index
- **7.5-10:** High Integration - System is generally flourishing, focus on maintaining and deepening
- **5-7.4:** Moderate Integration - Some domains thriving while others struggle, targeted interventions needed
- **Below 5:** Integration Crisis - Urgent attention needed, likely experiencing chronic stress/dysfunction

### Domain Range
- **0-2 points:** Well-integrated across domains
- **3-4 points:** Moderate fragmentation, watch for cascade effects
- **5+ points:** Severe fragmentation, one strong domain likely compensating for weak ones (unsustainable)

### Common Patterns

**The Achiever Pattern** (High Cognitive/Behavioral, Low Biological/Emotional)
- Productive but burning out
- Classic Orange integration failure
- Intervention: Sovereign Floor (remove survival coercion), add contemplative practice

**The Empath Pattern** (High Emotional/Social, Low Cognitive/Behavioral)
- Connected but paralyzed
- Classic Green trap
- Intervention: Cognitive scaffolding for structure, values-behavior alignment work

**The Survivor Pattern** (Low across all domains)
- System in crisis, no domain thriving
- Intervention: Triage - biological stabilization first (safety, rest, food), then build from there

**The Compensator Pattern** (One domain 9-10, others 3-5)
- Using one strength to mask dysfunction elsewhere
- Unsustainable - will eventually collapse
- Intervention: Address weakest domain directly, don't just optimize the strong one

## For Organizations: Team Integration Map

If assessing a team or organization, consider scoring each domain for different levels:

| Level | Bio | Cog | Emo | Beh | Soc | Spir | Index |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-------|
| Leadership | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | ___ |
| Middle Mgmt | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | ___ |
| Frontline | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | ___ |
| Systems/Policy | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | __ | ___ |

**Pattern Insight:** Do different levels show different integration profiles? This reveals structural issues vs. cultural ones.

## For Cities: Community Integration Dashboard

If assessing a city or community, consider tracking these supplementary metrics:

**Biological:** Life expectancy, chronic disease rates, access to green space
**Cognitive:** Educational attainment, library usage, screen-free zones
**Emotional:** Mental health access, community support networks, suicide rates
**Behavioral:** Civic participation, voting rates, volunteer hours
**Social:** Trust surveys, third-place density, diversity index
**Spiritual:** Sacred space access, community ritual participation, wisdom councils

## Sharing Your Data

**For the collective learning:**

If you're willing to share your integration profile (anonymously or publicly), it helps build the evidence base for what works.

Submit to the Global Governance Frameworks living database:
- **Email:** contact@globalgovernanceframeworks.org
- **Subject:** "Integration Scorecard Data"
- **Include:** Scope (individual/org/city), scores, interventions tried, outcomes

Your data helps others. Your experiments inform the next person's playbook.

## A Final Note on Measurement

Remember: **This scorecard is a map, not the territory.**

The numbers are diagnostic tools, not performance targets. If you find yourself optimizing scores rather than improving actual integration, you've fallen into Goodhart's Law (Appendix C).

The goal isn't a perfect "10" across all domains. The goal is:
- **Awareness** of where integration is failing
- **Action** toward structural improvement
- **Honesty** about what's working and what isn't
- **Tracking** to see if interventions actually help

Integration isn't achieved—it's practiced. This scorecard helps you practice with intention.

Use it as a mirror, not a grade.
