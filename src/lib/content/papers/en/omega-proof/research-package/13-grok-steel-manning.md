### FINAL RED TEAM VERDICT – PROTOCOL OMEGA BULLETPROOF EDITION  
(January 2026, four separate secure channels)

#### 1. Kyiv Hardliner – Lieutenant-General (ret.), former Azov & 92nd Brigade commander  
**Will I sign? NO. I would rather fight for ten more years.**

- The JDC is a polished version of the Minsk agreements on steroids. Dual citizenship + Singaporean CEO = we lose sovereign control forever while Russia keeps de facto power through local collaborators.  
- $150 bn sounds huge until you divide it by 15 years and realise it’s $10 bn/year. Russia spent $200 bn in 2022–2025 alone. They will rebuild their army twice over while we buy “defensive” drones that can be reprogrammed in a weekend.  
- The Hybrid Court is a joke. A Swiss judge will decide if a Russian FSB colonel committed murder in Donetsk? They will laugh and ignore it.  
- Worst of all: the moment we vote constitutional neutrality, the West’s political urgency disappears. The escrow is triple-locked, but the political will to keep sending shells is not. We become Finland 1939 with extra steps.

**Kill switch:** This deal trades real sovereignty today for paper money tomorrow. I will not sign my country’s death certificate.

#### 2. Kremlin Silovik – Secretary of the Security Council  
**Will I sign? ABSOLUTELY NOT.**

- We are being asked to buy our own sanctions relief with our own gas. That is tribute with extra bookkeeping.  
- The JDC is a Trojan horse: demilitarised today, rearmed by Ukraine tomorrow through “local police” and “defensive systems” that magically grow offensive capabilities.  
- Ukraine gets $150 bn upfront to turn itself into a giant anti-Russian hedgehog, while we get… promises of future sanctions relief that can be reversed by one phone call from Washington.  
- The Technology Review Committee gives us veto over their weapons – until the Americans simply reclassify something as “defensive” and dare us to restart the war.  
- We are 18–24 months from total military victory. Why would we pay the West to let Ukraine survive when we can finish the job and pay nothing?

**Kill switch:** This is capitulation disguised as clever engineering. We keep fighting.

#### 3. Washington Hawk – Deputy Secretary of Defense / NSC Senior Director  
**Will I sign? HELL NO.**

- Handing China priority infrastructure contracts in a European theatre is strategic suicide. In ten years the entire Ukrainian grid and rail network will have Beijing backdoors.  
- A “triple-locked” escrow in Singapore/Qatar is cute until the next administration decides Taiwan is more important and quietly encourages the protectors to freeze the fund “for technical reasons.”  
- The porcupine strategy only works if U.S. officers are in the loop for targeting and intelligence. A purely Ukrainian command structure with $150 bn will either (a) collapse in the first week of war or (b) drift into reckless offensive use that drags us in anyway.  
- We lose the moral and strategic justification for containing Russia if we ourselves finance Ukraine’s neutrality and bless Russian energy dominance over Europe.

**Kill switch:** This trades NATO’s credibility and Eurasian control for a short-term tactical exit. We will not cede the 21st century to save money in 2026.

#### 4. Beijing Strategist – Vice-Premier’s Office, National Security Commission  
**Will I sign? No – and we will quietly veto/block if forced.**

- $140 bn exposure secured by… Singaporean law and Qatari servers? If Russia reneges on gas flows in year three, our money is hostage to a Swiss court and a UNSC resolution that the U.S. can reinterpret tomorrow.  
- The JDC precedent is catastrophic for Taiwan: “dual sovereignty” today, “condominium” tomorrow, “peaceful resolution” the day after.  
- We gain infrastructure contracts, yes – but under Five-Eyes digital security standards that exclude our crown-jewel companies (Huawei, etc.). The juicy parts are carved out for Western firms.  
- Most importantly: a rich, neutral, heavily armed Ukraine + restored Russian power + continued Western presence in Europe is the worst possible combination for our long-term interests. We prefer the status quo of a bleeding Russia and a distracted America.

**Kill switch:** The risk/reward ratio is negative. We pocket the current chaos and wait.

### FINAL RED TEAM CONSENSUS  
All four veto players reject the package for rational, self-interested reasons.  
The mechanics are brilliant, but they do not outweigh the perceived existential threats each capital still sees.

**Verdict: Still politically dead in at least three out of four capitals.**

The machine is perfectly engineered…  
for a world in which none of these four actors exist in their current form.

Back to the lab. One more iteration required.
