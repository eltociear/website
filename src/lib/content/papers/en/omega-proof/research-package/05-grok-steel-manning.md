### KILL MEMO 1 – Kyiv Hardliner / Veteran (Azov & 92nd Brigade veterans’ chat, December 2025)

We have bled for every metre since 2014.  
This paper is the Budapest Memorandum 2.0 written by people who will never have to live with the consequences.

1. You want us to **freeze the line today** and call the Russian-occupied territories an “SAZ” for 15 years?  
   That is not a freeze. That is permanent Russian annexation with extra paperwork. In 15 years our children will vote in a referendum organised by the same UN that watched Rwanda and Srebrenica happen. The demographic engineering is already done – anyone who would vote Ukraine has been expelled or killed.

2. “Bilateral defence treaty with the US and UK” is meaningless.  
   We were told exactly the same in 1994 when we gave up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal. Result: 2014, 2022. The US–Japan treaty works because Japan is an island 7 000 km from Russia. Ukraine shares a 2 000 km border. When the next Russian offensive comes, will the US really invoke a bilateral treaty and risk New York for Kharkiv? Of course not.

3. The peacekeeping force from “India, Brazil, Indonesia” is a joke.  
   None of them have fought a high-intensity war in 70 years. They will do exactly what the UN did in 1992–95 in Bosnia: watch, take selfies, and then leave when the first soldier gets killed.

4. This entire paper is written for Moscow’s convenience.  
   Russia keeps everything it has seized, pays nothing in cash, and gets sanctions relief. We get promises on paper and lose 20 % of our country forever.

Verdict: This is not peace. This is capitulation dressed up as diplomacy.  
Any Ukrainian politician who signs this will be hanging from a lamp post in Kyiv within 48 hours.

### KILL MEMO 2 – Kremlin Silovik (FSB/SVR/GRU closed briefing, December 2025)

We are currently advancing 200–800 m per day at the cost of 800–1 200 lives. The West is running out of 155 mm shells and political will. Trump or a Trump-like figure wins in Europe 2026–2027. Why the hell would we stop now?

1. The SAZ is a Trojan horse.  
   Today it is “neutral”. Tomorrow the Americans will fly in “trainers” under the bilateral treaty, then “defensive systems”, then F-16s. We have seen this movie before (Kosovo → NATO member in 17 years).

2. Discounted gas for 15 years = tribute by another name.  
   We are being asked to subsidise European industry while our soldiers die. The political cost inside Russia is catastrophic.

3. Phased sanctions relief is a trap.  
   Every phase can be blocked by a single phone call from Washington (“Russia didn’t comply fully”). We have zero trust.

4. We do not need a deal.  
   We are grinding forward. In 12–18 months we reach the Dnipropetrovsk–Zaporizhzhia line, collapse the Ukrainian front, and dictate terms from a position of absolute strength. The West will fold the moment the first European capital turns the heating off.

Verdict: This paper is a Western attempt to freeze the front at the moment of maximum Ukrainian weakness and cheat Russia of total victory. We reject it completely.

### KILL MEMO 3 – Washington/NATO Institutionalist (NSC + SHAPE secure VTC, December 2025)

This proposal is strategic malpractice and would destroy the credibility of the United States as a security guarantor for decades.

1. Abandoning NATO Article 5 for Ukraine = abandoning it for the Baltics and Poland tomorrow.  
   If we accept that a bilateral treaty is “good enough” for Kyiv, Tallinn and Warsaw will immediately ask why they are still in NATO at all.

2. The “Global South peacekeeping force” is security theatre.  
   None of those armies have the logistics, the ISR, or the political will to fight the Russian army. The moment Russia decides to re-enter the SAZ (and it will), the peacekeepers will evaporate exactly like UNPROFOR in 1995.

3. Bringing China onto the IRFU board is insane.  
   You are handing Beijing veto power over the reconstruction of a European country and inviting Chinese state companies to build dual-use infrastructure 300 km from NATO’s border.

4. We do not negotiate NATO membership away. Ever.  
   That is the original sin that started this war in Russian eyes. Codifying it in a UNSC resolution legitimises every Russian grievance and guarantees the next war.

Verdict: This package undermines the entire post-1945 American security order. We will veto any such resolution and instruct allies to do the same.

### KILL MEMO 4 – Beijing Strategist (Central National Security Commission briefing, December 2025)

From a cold Chinese national-interest perspective, the current war is close to ideal. It bleeds Russia, divides the West, and keeps American attention fixed on Europe.

This proposal asks us to end that perfect situation for almost zero strategic gain.

1. Why stabilise Europe now?  
   Every additional year of war weakens Russia (our nominal partner) and fractures NATO cohesion. A united, prosperous Ukraine inside the EU is the last thing we want on Russia’s border.

2. The “energy levy” precedent is radioactive.  
   If the international community can force Russia to pay reconstruction with discounted resources, tomorrow the same logic will be used against China in any Taiwan contingency (“pay with semiconductors or rare earths”).

3. Chinese companies get contracts?  
   We can get those contracts anyway once the West runs out of money (which is happening). Why spend political capital and legitimise a UNSC mechanism that can be turned against us later?

4. We hold the ultimate leverage: we can veto the entire thing in the Security Council and watch the West squirm.

Verdict: We have zero incentive to rescue the West from a war it started. We will abstain at best, veto if necessary, and continue to profit from the chaos.

### CONCLUSION OF THE RED TEAM

The proposal is simultaneously:  
- Unacceptable capitulation to Ukraine’s patriots  
- Unacceptable strategic retreat to Russia’s siloviki  
- Unacceptable dilution of NATO credibility to Washington  
- Unacceptable stabilisation of the West to Beijing  

In other words: everyone with a veto hates it for exactly the reasons that make it “balanced”.

The package, in its current form, is politically dead on arrival in all four capitals that matter.

Back to the drawing board.
