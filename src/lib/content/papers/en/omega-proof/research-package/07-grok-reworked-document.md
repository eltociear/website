**CONFIDENTIAL WORKING PAPER – PROTOCOL OMEGA**  
**Date:** 20 December 2025  
**Classification:** Strictly not for public release – Deputy-minister level and above only  
**Origin:** Closed-door drafting group (Swiss, Turkish, Indian, Brazilian, South African, Qatari, Singaporean channels)  
**Intended recipients:**  
Office of the President of Ukraine ∙ Russian Presidential Administration ∙ U.S. National Security Council ∙ Chinese State Council (Vice-Premier level) ∙ European External Action Service ∙ Foreign Ministries of Türkiye, India, Brazil, South Africa, Qatar, Singapore ∙ UN DPPA ∙ World Bank

### Core Insight from the Red Team Exercise  
The previous version died because it asked every capital to publicly swallow a territorial or financial loss.  
No leader who has to survive domestic politics can do that in 2025–2026.

Protocol Omega therefore removes the two lethal words from the table:  
- No “frozen lines”  
- No “reparations / levy / tribute”

It replaces them with three new principles that are politically sellable in every capital:

1. Territory → Flows  
2. Reparations → Investment  
3. Guarantees → Capacity

### The Three-Pillar Deal

#### Pillar 1 – The Non-Territorial Zone (Flows, not Lines)

Area: All territory east of the current contact line + Crimea.

Legal status 2026–2041 (15-year fixed term):  
**Joint Development Condominium (JDC)** – a new legal creature deliberately designed to give neither side a clear “win” or “loss” on sovereignty.

Key features  
- Residents keep their existing passport and can acquire a second one (Ukrainian, Russian, or neutral JDC passport).  
- They vote in whichever national elections they choose (or abstain).  
- Land and fixed assets remain registered as they are today – no mass property re-registration, no forced sales.  
- Day-to-day governance: locally elected councils (current mayors stay in place).  
- Security: fully demilitarised except for light police. No foreign troops of any kind. Enforcement via mutual satellite monitoring + automatic economic penalties (see Pillar 2).  
- Primary activity: ecological restoration, industrial rebuilding, and new energy/agri projects. All contracts awarded by a joint Ukrainian-Russian-World Bank board.

Political sell in Kyiv: “We never recognised the annexation; our citizens keep Ukrainian passports and rights; in practice we regain economic access and population ties.”  
Political sell in Moscow: “We never withdrew; our citizens keep Russian passports; the land bridge and Crimea stay under Russian law in practice.”

Neither side has to admit defeat on the sovereignty question.

#### Pillar 2 – Eurasian Energy & Reconstruction Partnership (Investment, not Tribute)

A new entity: **Eurasian Reconstruction and Energy Transition Fund (ERETF)**  
Board: Russia (25 %), EU (25 %), China (20 %), United States (15 %), World Bank (15 %).

Funding 2026–2041  
- Russia routes 35 % of its Europe-bound pipeline gas and electricity through a dedicated ERETF metering system.  
- The commercial value of that gas/electricity (at market price) is credited to Russia as its voluntary founding contribution.  
- China adds USD 120 billion in concessional loans for green infrastructure across the entire region (JDC + rest of Ukraine).  
- EU + G7 + Gulf add matching grants/loans.

Outcome  
- Ukraine receives ≈ USD 45–50 bn per year for reconstruction with no Russian veto on spending outside the JDC.  
- Russia is recorded as the largest single donor (face-saving) and regains full energy leverage over Europe.  
- China becomes the indispensable reconstruction partner and locks in long-term Eurasian stability.

No one uses the word “reparations”. Everyone uses the word “investment”.

#### Pillar 3 – Armed Neutrality & Capacity Transfer (Capacity, not Paper Guarantees)

Ukraine formally commits to permanent armed neutrality (no NATO, no Russian bases).

In return, the West transfers the physical means to make any new invasion prohibitively expensive:

2026–2032 package (already budgeted in various forms)  
- 1 000+ long-range strike drones per year  
- Full Patriot + IRIS-T + NASAMS coverage of all cities west of the Dnipro  
- Permanent Western licensing and co-production of 155 mm artillery, missiles, and electronic warfare systems inside Ukraine  
- Cyber-defence backbone run jointly by NSA/GCHQ and Ukrainian services  
- USD 8–10 bn annual “Defensive Systems Fund” (U.S. + EU) that cannot be blocked by future Congresses or Bundestags because it is pre-authorised as “Israel-style” memorandum

Political sell in Kyiv: “We become the porcupine of Europe – too painful to swallow.”  
Political sell in Moscow: “No NATO – our core demand is met forever.”  
Political sell in Washington: “We spend the same money we are already spending, but we get a neutral, heavily armed buffer that removes the endless bleeding.”

### Sanctions Relief Schedule (the real carrot for Moscow)

- Month 0 (signing): immediate lifting of all agricultural, fertiliser, and civilian aviation sanctions.  
- Month 6 (JDC operational, gas metering begins): full energy-sector and banking (SWIFT) restoration except individuals/entities on existing SDN lists.  
- Year 2: all remaining non-military sanctions lifted.

### Next Concrete Steps (January–May 2026)

1. Closed-door P5+2 meeting (U.S., China, Russia, Ukraine, EU, Türkiye, India) in Doha or Singapore to initial the principles.  
2. Parallel technical teams draft the ERETF charter and the armed-neutrality capacity transfer annexes.  
3. Signing ceremony in neutral capital (Ankara or Astana) before summer 2026.

This is no longer a compromise.  
It is a synthesis in which every major player can claim, in good faith, that they achieved their strategic minimum without publicly conceding their maximum.

We are ready for immediate deputy-level briefings.

End of paper.
