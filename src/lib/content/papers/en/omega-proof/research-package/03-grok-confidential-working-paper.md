**CONFIDENTIAL WORKING PAPER**  
**Strictly not for public circulation – Eyes-only diplomatic channel**  
**Date:** 15 December 2025  
**Title:** A Phased Neutrality, Reconstruction and Security Settlement for Ukraine  
**Origin:** Joint drafting group (Swiss/Turkish/Indian/Brazilian/South African diplomatic channels, with quiet P5+ soundings)  
**Intended recipients:**  
Office of the President of Ukraine ∙ Russian Presidential Administration ∙ U.S. National Security Council ∙ Chinese State Council (Vice Premier level) ∙ European External Action Service ∙ Foreign Ministries of Türkiye, India, Brazil, South Africa, Switzerland, Indonesia ∙ UN DPPA ∙ World Bank ∙ Vatican Secretariat of State

### Executive Summary (the only page most recipients will read)

The war has reached a mutually hurting stalemate. Neither decisive military victory nor indefinite attrition is politically or economically sustainable past 2027.

This paper presents the only known package that simultaneously satisfies the non-negotiable minimum demands of Kyiv, Moscow, Washington, and Beijing, while giving Europe affordable energy and the Global South prestige and contracts.

Core bargain in four sentences  
1. Fighting stops and the line is frozen where it stands.  
2. The current Russian-controlled territories become a 15-year Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) under UN-mandated neutral administration and Global South-led peacekeeping.  
3. Ukraine receives full-scale reconstruction financed by a symmetric energy-for-aid + Chinese loans mechanism that avoids the word “reparations”.  
4. Ukraine receives iron-clad security guarantees and fast-track EU membership, but **not** NATO membership – closing Russia’s brightest red line while giving the U.S. a dignified exit ramp.

### Phase 1 – Immediate Cessation of Hostilities (0–9 months)

- Full ceasefire monitored by expanded OSCE SMM (3 000 monitors).  
- Mutual withdrawal of heavy weapons 50 km, verified in real time by satellite/drone imagery shared with all P5.  
- All-for-all prisoner exchange + five humanitarian corridors.  
- Co-guarantors: Türkiye + Switzerland + India (all have working relations with both parties).

### Phase 2 – The 15-Year Special Administrative Zone (Years 1–15)

Legal basis: UN Security Council Chapter VII resolution drafted and tabled jointly by the United States and China (with Russia voting yes, France/UK abstaining or voting yes).

Territory: All areas currently under Russian control + 20 km buffer.

Governance & Security  
- Temporary UN-led International Administration (model: Kosovo UNMIK 1999–2008).  
- Day-to-day civil administration remains Ukrainian officials under UN oversight.  
- Peacekeeping force of 25 000–30 000 troops contributed exclusively by neutral/Global South states (India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Kazakhstan). No NATO or regular Russian forces inside the SAZ.  
- Freedom of movement, dual ID documents, property claims frozen and processed by a World Bank-administered commission.

Primary mission (creates millions of jobs and political buy-in):  
1. Largest de-mining operation in history  
2. Environmental restoration and soil remediation  
3. Full reconstruction of infrastructure – contracts open to companies from all countries on equal footing

Year 15: internationally supervised referendum on final status (options pre-agreed in the UNSC resolution).

### Phase 3 – The Symmetric Reconstruction Finance Mechanism

Total volume 2026–2041: USD 480–520 billion

**International Reconstruction Fund for Ukraine (IRFU)**  
Governed by a board: World Bank (chair) + United States + EU + China + India + Brazil + Switzerland

Funding sources (explicitly designed to be domestically sellable everywhere):

A. Russia supplies natural gas and electricity to Europe at 35 % below market price for 15 years → discounted value credited as Russia’s contribution (≈ USD 200 bn).  
B. G7 + EU + Gulf + Korea/Japan provide matching grant/loan commitments (already pledged in principle).  
C. Chinese policy banks (CDB, Exim) provide USD 80–100 bn in concessional loans for designated non-military infrastructure inside the SAZ and the rest of Ukraine → Beijing gets prestige, contracts, and a flagship “global security initiative” project.

Result  
- Ukraine receives full reconstruction without humiliating cash transfers from Moscow.  
- Russia avoids the word “reparations” and regains a central energy role.  
- Europe gets 15 years of affordable energy.  
- China becomes an indispensable stakeholder instead of a spoiler.  
- United States can declare “responsible end to the war” and pivot resources to Asia.

### Phase 4 – Security Guarantees and European Integration (the new red-line settlement)

Ukraine receives:  
- Bilateral defense treaties with the United States and United Kingdom (model: U.S.–Japan Security Treaty)  
- EU membership fast-track (accession negotiations concluded by 2030)  
- Permanent stationing of European (non-NATO-framework) troops on Ukrainian territory west of the Dnipro if desired

Explicitly excluded: NATO membership for any part of Ukraine for the duration of the SAZ (15 years), with possibility of review thereafter.

This is the only formulation that simultaneously satisfies Moscow’s core demand (“no NATO”) and gives Kyiv credible, enforceable security without Article 5.

### Political Sellability (how each capital can present it at home)

Kyiv  
“85–90 % of Ukraine regains full sovereignty immediately, receives the largest reconstruction package in history, gets EU membership and U.S. bilateral defense treaty. The occupied territories return to international oversight and will vote in 15 years under conditions we will dominate demographically and economically.”

Moscow  
“We secured the land bridge forever, permanently blocked NATO expansion to our borders, avoided Versailles-style reparations, regained energy leverage over Europe, and obtained phased sanctions relief.”

Washington  
“We ended the war responsibly, prevented direct NATO-Russia conflict, locked in discounted Russian gas for our European allies, brought China into a Western-managed financial mechanism, and freed up resources for the Indo-Pacific.”

Beijing  
“China played the decisive peacemaker role, secured massive infrastructure contracts, demonstrated our Global Security Initiative works, and prevented a permanent Western military foothold on Russia’s border.”

Europe  
“15 years of cheaper energy, no more body bags, Ukraine rebuilt, and EU enlargement finally happens.”

Global South peacekeepers  
“First post-Cold-War peacekeeping operation led by non-Western powers – historic prestige and billions in contracts.”

### Sanctions Relief Timeline (the missing carrot for Moscow)

- Upon verified heavy-weapons withdrawal: immediate lifting of agricultural/fertiliser sanctions.  
- Upon SAZ establishment and discounted gas flows begin: lifting of all non-strategic financial and energy-sector sanctions.  
- Upon full IRFU operationalisation: further staged relief calibrated to compliance.

### Next Concrete Steps (January–April 2026)

1. Secure confidential, high-level exploratory nods from Washington (Deputy NSA) and Beijing (Vice Premier or Special Envoy) that the broad architecture is worth joint exploration.  
2. Convene a closed-door drafting meeting in Geneva or Doha: U.S. + China + Russia + Ukraine + Türkiye + India + Brazil + Switzerland (deputy-minister level).  
3. Produce a joint P5+ UNSC resolution text by April 2026.  
4. Parallel religious Track 1.5 process (Vatican + Ecumenical Patriarch + Moscow Patriarchate representative) to bless the humanitarian and moral dimensions.

This is no longer a middle-power end-run.  
It is a **P5-managed grand bargain** that gives every major player something they can sell domestically and denies no one their absolute minimum requirement.

We stand ready to brief any recipient at the appropriate level, in absolute confidentiality.

End of paper.
