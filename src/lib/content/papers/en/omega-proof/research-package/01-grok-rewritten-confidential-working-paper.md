**CONFIDENTIAL WORKING PAPER**  
**Not for public circulation – For quiet diplomacy only**  
**Date:** 4 December 2025  
**Title:** A Phased Neutrality and Reconstruction Mechanism for Eastern Ukraine  
**Origin:** Independent strategic initiative (European and Global South mediators)  
**Intended recipients:** Office of the President of Ukraine ∙ Russian Presidential Administration ∙ U.S. National Security Council ∙ European External Action Service ∙ Foreign Ministries of Türkiye, India, Brazil, South Africa, Switzerland ∙ UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs ∙ World Bank Ukraine Office

### Executive Summary (one page – the only page most people will read)

The war is militarily unwinnable for both sides at acceptable cost.  
A decisive battlefield victory for either party is no longer plausible before 2027–2028, by which time the economic, demographic and political damage to both countries (and to European security) will be irreversible.

This paper presents a **face-saving, legally enforceable, financially realistic off-ramp** that can be sold domestically in Kyiv, Moscow, Washington and European capitals.

Core idea in three sentences:  
1. Freeze the line where it is.  
2. Turn the entire current contact zone (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson oblasts under Russian control + a 20 km buffer) into a **15-year Special Administrative Zone (SAZ)** under temporary international administration.  
3. Finance the reconstruction of the rest of Ukraine (and the SAZ itself) through a symmetric energy-for-aid swap that gives Russia a dignified economic role instead of cash reparations.

No new global institutions.  
Only existing, respected bodies: UN Security Council mandate ∙ OSCE ∙ World Bank ∙ neutral-state troop contributors ∙ existing religious mediators (Vatican + Orthodox patriarchates).

### Phase 1 – Immediate Humanitarian Cessation (0–6 months)

Objective: Stop the killing and create political space.

- Mutual commitment to a full ceasefire monitored by expanded OSCE SMM (add 2 000 monitors, funded by EU + U.S.).  
- Withdrawal of heavy weapons 30 km from the line (as in Minsk II, but this time enforced by satellite + drone verification with real-time data shared to all parties).  
- Opening of five humanitarian corridors (UNHCR + ICRC lead).  
- Prisoner exchange “all for all” (already 80 % agreed in principle in Istanbul 2022).  
- Türkiye + Switzerland as co-guarantors (both have recent track record).

Political cover:  
Kyiv sells it as “humanitarian pause to rebuild the country”.  
Moscow sells it as “protection of the Russian-speaking population”.

### Phase 2 – The Special Administrative Zone (Years 1–15)

Legal basis: UN Security Council Chapter VII resolution (possible with China/India/Brazil abstention or yes vote if NATO membership for the rest of Ukraine is explicitly excluded).

Territory: Current Russian-controlled areas + 20 km buffer.  
Name: “Special Administrative Zone of Eastern Ukraine” (SAZ).

Governance for 15 years:  
- Temporary International Administration (UN + OSCE) modelled on Kosovo 1999–2008 and East Timor 1999–2002.  
- Day-to-day civil administration by local Ukrainian officials (paid by Kyiv) under international oversight.  
- Security provided by a neutral-state peacekeeping force of 20 000–25 000 troops from India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Türkiye, Egypt (all countries that both sides have spoken to in the last 18 months).  
- Explicit prohibition of NATO and Russian regular forces inside the SAZ.  
- Freedom of movement for civilians; dual ID cards accepted; property rights frozen and adjudicated by a bilateral claims commission (World Bank model used in Bosnia).

Primary mission of the international presence:  
1. Mine/UXO clearance (largest such operation in history – creates millions of jobs).  
2. Environmental restoration (soil remediation, water treatment).  
3. Infrastructure rebuild (roads, power grid, hospitals) – contracts open to companies from all countries, including Russian firms on equal footing.

At year 15: referendum under OSCE supervision on final status (options pre-agreed: return to Ukraine with enhanced autonomy, independence, or – theoretically – accession to Russia). The long delay makes the referendum politically palatable to both sides today.

### Phase 3 – Symmetric Reconstruction Finance (the real innovation)

Neither side will accept the other’s narrative on reparations.

Solution: no cash reparations from Russia, no “victory fund” from the West.

Instead: **International Reconstruction Fund for Ukraine** (IRFU)  
- Managed by World Bank + EBRD + neutral-state board (India, Brazil, Switzerland).  
- Total volume 2026–2040: USD 400–500 billion (realistic estimate).  

Funding sources (symmetric, face-saving):

A. Russia supplies natural gas and electricity to Europe at 30–40 % below market price for 15 years.  
   The discounted value (estimated USD 180–220 bn) is credited to Russia’s contribution to the Fund.

B. G7 + EU + Gulf states + South Korea + Japan provide the matching USD 220–280 bn in grants and concessional loans (already pledged in principle at various recovery conferences).

Result:  
- Ukraine gets full reconstruction without having to extract cash from a bankrupt Russia.  
- Russia avoids the word “reparations” and retains a central role in European energy (which Moscow desperately wants).  
- Europe secures discounted energy for a decade, easing the political cost of the war.

### Political Sellability (how to pitch it in each capital)

Kyiv  
“Frozen conflict becomes frozen asset. We get the whole country rebuilt, NATO path for 85 % of territory, and in 15 years the people decide – with our demographic and economic advantage we win the referendum.”

Moscow  
“We secured the land bridge, blocked NATO expansion forever in the SAZ, avoided Versailles-style reparations, and regained energy leverage over Europe.”

Washington / Brussels  
“We end the bleeding, prevent escalation, secure discounted Russian gas (huge for European voters), and rebuild Ukraine without China filling the vacuum.”

Neutral contributors (India, Brazil, etc.)  
“First major post-Cold-War peacekeeping operation led by the Global South – prestige + contracts.”

### Religious & Moral Legitimisation (quiet channel)

Parallel Track II process led jointly by:  
- Vatican (Pope Francis has direct line to both Zelenskyy and Kirill)  
- Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (recognised by Kyiv)  
- Patriarch Kirill or his representative (to avoid total exclusion)

Their role: bless the humanitarian pause, provide moral cover for the long delay on final status, and mobilise faith-based NGOs for reconstruction inside the SAZ.

### Risks & Mitigations

Risk: Russia refuses to withdraw heavy weapons.  
Mitigation: phased implementation – Russian discount gas begins only after verifiable withdrawal.

Risk: Ukraine refuses any special status.  
Mitigation: explicit NATO membership path for the rest of Ukraine (the 85 %) is part of the package – something Kyiv has said is non-negotiable.

Risk: spoilers (hardliners on both sides).  
Mitigation: the 15-year clock and the economic benefits are designed to change the domestic political calculus over time.

### Next quiet steps (January–March 2026)

1. Soundings in Ankara, New Delhi, Brasília, Pretoria.  
2. Informal paper presented to Lavrov and Kuleba separately via Swiss or Turkish channels.  
3. If no immediate rejection, convene a closed-door meeting of the five neutral candidates + UN + World Bank in Geneva or Doha to draft the UNSC resolution text.

This is not a utopian proposal.  
It is a brutal, realist, face-saving mechanism built on precedents that already worked (Kosovo, East Timor, Bosnia property commission, German post-WW2 debt restructuring).

It gives every stakeholder something they can sell at home, and denies no one their core red line often enough to make compromise possible.

We are ready to brief any of the recipients at deputy-minister level or above, in total confidentiality.

End of paper.
