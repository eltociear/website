**CONFIDENTIAL WORKING PAPER – PROTOCOL OMEGA (Final Turnkey Version)**  
**Date:** 28 December 2025  
**Classification:** Eyes-only – Deputy-minister / Vice-Premier level and above  
**Origin:** Joint Swiss–Turkish–Qatari–Singapore drafting group  
**Intended recipients:**  
Office of the President of Ukraine ∙ Russian Presidential Administration ∙ U.S. National Security Council ∙ Chinese State Council ∙ European External Action Service ∙ Foreign Ministries of India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Qatar, Singapore ∙ UN DPPA ∙ World Bank ∙ Swiss National Bank (escrow agent)

### The Deal in One Paragraph (the only paragraph most leaders will read)

Russia keeps de facto control of the land bridge and Crimea, regains full energy leverage over Europe, and exits sanctions within 24 months.  
Ukraine receives permanent armed neutrality plus an irreversible, pre-capitalised $120–150 bn defence endowment and $50 bn/year reconstruction money.  
China becomes the lead infrastructure financier of the new Eastern Eurasian Stability Corridor.  
The West ends the war, pivots to Asia, and locks in 15 years of affordable Russian gas.  
No one has to admit territorial loss or pay reparations in public.

### The Four Operative Pillars (now with fail-safes)

#### Pillar 1 – Joint Development Condominium (JDC) 2026–2041  
Territory: All land east of the February 2022 line + Crimea

Legal innovation  
- Dual/sovereignty fog: residents keep existing passports + optional second passport. They vote in whichever national elections they choose.  
- Fixed assets remain registered exactly as they are today – no forced re-registration.  
- Governance: locally elected councils continue. New **JDC Development Authority (JDA)** – rotating Ukrainian/Russian co-chair + World Bank CEO – approves all reconstruction contracts and runs the dual-passport registry. No security or foreign-policy powers.

Security  
- Total demilitarisation except light police.  
- Automatic economic penalties (via ERETF escrow) for any violation verified by Swiss/Indian satellite monitoring.

#### Pillar 2 – Eurasian Reconstruction & Energy Transition Fund (ERETF)

Board (voting power)  
Russia 25 % ∙ EU 25 % ∙ China 20 % ∙ United States 15 % ∙ World Bank 15 %

Capitalisation 2026–2041  
- Russia: 35 % of Europe-bound pipeline gas/electricity metered through ERETF → credited at full market price as its “founding donor contribution”.  
- China: USD 120–150 bn concessional 50-year loans, priority contractor status for green/digital infrastructure.  
- EU/G7/Gulf: matching grants/loans (already pledged).  

Annual disbursement  
≈ USD 48–52 bn/year, of which 70 % to Ukraine proper, 30 % to JDC projects.

#### Pillar 3 – Permanent Armed Neutrality + Irreversible Capacity

Ukraine amends its constitution to permanent neutrality (no NATO, no foreign bases).

In return, two irrevocable funds are created on Day 1 and capitalised within 90 days:

A. **Ukrainian Defense Sovereignty Endowment (UDSE)**  
- Size: USD 120–150 bn (10–15 years of contributions paid upfront).  
- Held in escrow by Swiss National Bank, invested only in AAA sovereign bonds.  
- Annual returns (≈ USD 8–10 bn) finance defensive systems forever. Politically untouchable.

B. **Verifiable Capabilities Treaty (VCT) Annex**  
- Public list of permitted systems (range-limited missiles, air defence, drones, EW).  
- Mutual inspection rights (Swiss/Indian teams) twice per year.  
- Any breach triggers automatic freeze of ERETF disbursements and re-imposition of sanctions.

This turns Ukraine into a nuclear-level porcupine without NATO membership.

#### Pillar 4 – Sanctions Exit Roadmap (locked, irreversible)

- Day +1 (signing): agricultural, fertiliser, civilian aviation sanctions lifted.  
- Month +6 (JDC operational + gas metering begins): SWIFT reconnection + all energy-sector sanctions lifted.  
- Month +24: all remaining non-military sanctions terminated.

### The Golden Bridge – Fail-Safe Signing Sequence (90-day clock)

| Day       | Action                                                                                     | Verifier                    |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Day 0     | All parties sign Framework Declaration in Astana                                          | Qatar & Singapore co-chairs |
| Day 1–60  | Capitalisation of UDSE + first Chinese loan tranche placed in Swiss National Bank escrow | SNB confirmation            |
| Day 61–75 | Ukrainian Rada votes constitutional neutrality amendment                                 | OSCE monitors               |
| Day 76    | Escrow releases first USD 15 bn to Ukraine; first tier sanctions lifted automatically     | Automatic                   |
| Day 90    | JDA begins operations; discounted gas metering starts; second tier sanctions lifted       | Automatic                   |

If any party blocks, escrow returns all money and the previous sanctions regime snaps back automatically. No trust required – pure mechanism.

### Political Sellability (one line each)

Kyiv  
“We become the best-armed neutral country in history with $50 bn/year reconstruction money and no territorial concession on paper.”

Moscow  
“We secured the land bridge forever, ended all meaningful sanctions in 24 months, and became Europe’s indispensable energy partner again.”

Washington  
“We end the war on our terms, pivot to China, and turn Ukraine into a giant Israel-style deterrent without Article 5 risk.”

Beijing  
“We finance and build the new Eastern Eurasian Corridor, lock in 50-year returns, and demonstrate that our Global Security Initiative actually works.”

Europe  
“15 years of cheap Russian gas, no more coffins, Ukraine rebuilt, NATO intact.”

### Annexes (ready for immediate signature)

1. Verifiable Capabilities Treaty (VCT) – 8 pages  
2. JDC Development Authority Charter – 6 pages  
3. UDSE Escrow Agreement (Swiss National Bank) – 4 pages  
4. ERETF Founding Statutes – 10 pages  
5. Golden Bridge 90-Day Sequence – 2 pages

This is no longer a diplomatic proposal.  
It is a **turnkey operating system** that can be signed, capitalised, and operational within 100 days.

We are ready to convene the Astana signing summit on 48 hours’ notice.

End of paper.
