# Validation & Integration

## Community-Controlled Evaluation and Authorization

The validation phase ensures that adapted frameworks genuinely serve community needs while maintaining cultural integrity through comprehensive evaluation by community members.

### Community-Defined Success Metrics

**Cultural Alignment Assessment**: Evaluation of whether adapted frameworks strengthen rather than weaken traditional governance capacity and cultural continuity.

**Effectiveness Evaluation**: Community-controlled assessment of whether frameworks achieve intended governance outcomes using culturally appropriate measures of success.

**Relationship Impact Analysis**: Examination of how framework implementation affects relationships within the community and with external partners.

### Traditional Authority Review

**Elder Council Approval**: Formal review and authorization by traditional governance authorities using established community decision-making processes.

**Cultural Validation**: Confirmation that adapted frameworks align with traditional teachings and do not violate cultural principles or spiritual requirements.

**Future Generation Consideration**: Assessment of how framework adoption will affect community capacity to transmit traditional knowledge and governance practices to future generations.
