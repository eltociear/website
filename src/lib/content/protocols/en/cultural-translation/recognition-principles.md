# Recognition Principles

## Honoring Indigenous Epistemologies and Governance Wisdom

This section establishes the foundational principles that guide respectful engagement with traditional knowledge systems and governance practices.

### Epistemological Sovereignty

Different cultures have fundamentally different ways of knowing and understanding reality. The protocol recognizes that these differences are not simply variations on universal themes but represent distinct approaches to existence that may be incompatible with Western frameworks.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge**: Recognition that Indigenous and traditional communities possess sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships developed over millennia of lived experience.

**Ceremonial Knowledge**: Acknowledgment that many governance practices are inseparable from spiritual and ceremonial contexts that cannot be extracted or secularized without losing essential meaning.

**Relational Ontologies**: Understanding that many cultures organize reality around relationships rather than objects, requiring different approaches to governance that honor this foundational difference.

### Power Analysis and Historical Context

All cultural translation occurs within contexts shaped by historical and ongoing colonization, racism, and cultural suppression. The protocol requires explicit analysis of these power dynamics:

**Historical Trauma Awareness**: Recognition of how past cultural suppression affects contemporary communities' relationships with external governance frameworks.

**Ongoing Marginalization**: Analysis of current power imbalances that may affect communities' capacity to participate equally in translation processes.

**Systemic Privilege**: Acknowledgment of how dominant culture frameworks may embed assumptions that privilege some worldviews over others.
