# Purpose & Foundation

## Establishing Ethical Groundwork for Cultural Translation

The foundation phase establishes the ethical, relational, and practical groundwork necessary for authentic cultural translation. This phase recognizes that rushing into technical adaptation without proper foundation inevitably leads to cultural harm, ineffective outcomes, or both.

### Community Sovereignty Establishment

Before any translation work begins, participating communities must establish clear boundaries around their authority, knowledge, and participation. This includes:

**Decision-Making Authority**: Clear designation of who has the right to speak for the community, make binding agreements, and authorize use of traditional knowledge. This may involve traditional councils, elected representatives, or other culturally appropriate governance structures.

**Knowledge Boundaries**: Explicit identification of what knowledge can be shared, what requires special protocols, and what remains protected. Many communities distinguish between general cultural knowledge and sacred or ceremonial knowledge that requires different handling.

**Participation Scope**: Clear agreements about what aspects of community life and governance are open to translation processes and what remains private or off-limits to external involvement.

### Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) 2.0

The protocol operates under enhanced FPIC principles that go beyond consultation to genuine power-sharing:

**Free**: Consent given without coercion, manipulation, or pressure from external actors. Communities have genuine alternatives including the option to refuse participation entirely.

**Prior**: Consent obtained before any translation activities begin, with opportunities to modify or withdraw consent throughout the process.

**Informed**: Complete information provided about potential benefits, risks, and implications of participation, including examples of both successful and unsuccessful cultural translation attempts.

**Ongoing**: Recognition that consent is not a one-time event but an ongoing relationship that requires continuous confirmation and may be modified or withdrawn.
