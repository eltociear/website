# Co-Design & Adaptation

## Collaborative Development of Culturally Appropriate Frameworks

The co-design phase involves iterative development of adapted frameworks through genuine partnership between traditional knowledge holders and framework developers.

### Adaptation Methodologies

**Cultural Concept Mapping**: Systematic identification of how governance concepts translate across cultural frameworks, noting where direct translation is impossible and alternative approaches are needed.

**Process Integration**: Development of decision-making processes that honor traditional approaches while enabling coordination with external systems.

**Language Development**: Creation of appropriate terminology in Indigenous languages rather than requiring adoption of foreign concepts.

### Pilot Testing Protocols

**Low-Stakes Implementation**: Initial testing in contexts where failure will not cause significant harm to community relationships or governance capacity.

**Feedback Integration**: Systematic collection and integration of community feedback, with particular attention to concerns from elders and traditional knowledge holders.

**Iteration Cycles**: Multiple rounds of testing and refinement based on real-world application rather than theoretical assessment.
