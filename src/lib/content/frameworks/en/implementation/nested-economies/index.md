**Framework Development**: The Nested Economies Framework creates practical tools for building economies of **Right Relationship** that balance local autonomy with global cooperation. This framework defines the **'where' and 'how'** of economic activity within the Global Governance Framework ecosystem, providing architectural rules for how local BAZ economies, regional trade networks, and global commons can interoperate without sacrificing community sovereignty.

**Revision**: 3.0 (2025-01-15) - Simplified to single Hearts currency, BAZ formation focus, Love Ledger separation, AUBI cross-referencing, and realistic implementation approach

In a world where economic integration typically forces communities to choose between isolation and exploitation, the **Nested Economies Framework** offers a revolutionary approach—positioning **Right Relationship** as the foundation for systems that honor both local self-determination and planetary cooperation through a single Hearts currency that recognizes diverse community contributions.

## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction: Economics of Right Relationship

**The Challenge**: Current economic models force impossible choices. The European Union prioritizes regulatory uniformity over local diversity. The WTO maximizes trade volumes while ignoring equity and sustainability. Degrowth movements risk economic stagnation. Meanwhile, communities worldwide lose economic sovereignty to distant markets and corporate extraction.

**The Opportunity**: For the first time, we can create economic systems that grow stronger through everyone's flourishing rather than extracting wealth from communities. We can build systems where local autonomy and global cooperation reinforce rather than undermine each other through a single Hearts currency that recognizes care work, ecological restoration, and cultural preservation.

**The Framework**: The Nested Economies Framework creates economic integration architecture through:

- **Single Hearts Currency**: Universal currency rewarding care economy activities, ecological restoration, and cultural preservation across all participating communities
- **Love Ledger System**: Separate contribution tracking for informal community work and relationship building
- **BAZ Formation Process**: Practical 4-step pathway (Convening Circle → Proto-Treasury → Community Providers → BAZ Council) for community economic sovereignty
- **AUBI Integration**: Coordination with AUBI Framework v5.0 for universal economic security and contribution recognition
- **Simplified Governance**: Clear two-tier system (BAZ Councils for local control, Social Resilience Council for global coordination)

### Framework Distinctions and Comparative Analysis

| Framework | Focus | Strength | Weakness | Our Innovation |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **European Union** | Regulatory harmonization | Economic unity, market access | Limits local autonomy, cultural standardization | **Single Hearts** currency preserves sovereignty within cooperation |
| **WTO** | Global trade maximization | Market access, efficiency | Ignores equity, environmental costs | **Resource Justice** and **Community Providers** center sustainability |
| **Degrowth Economics** | Reduced consumption | Ecological focus, simplicity | Risk of economic stagnation | **Regenerative growth** through **Hearts** rewards for care and restoration |
| **Doughnut Economics** | Planetary boundaries | Holistic metrics, clear limits | Limited interoperability tools | **Universal Hearts** currency enables seamless cooperation |
| **Nested Economies** | **Right Relationship** | Local autonomy + global cooperation | Implementation complexity | **BAZ formation** + **Community Weavers** provide practical pathways |

### Key Principles

- **🔵 Sovereignty**: Local communities control economic decisions through BAZ Councils and Community Provider chartering
- **🟢 Interoperability**: Universal Hearts currency enables seamless trade between all participating communities
- **🔴 Resource Justice**: Equitable access through AUBI Framework v5.0 integration and 10% solidarity redistribution
- **🟣 Adaptability**: Cultural accommodation through BAZ-level adaptation and Indigenous Earth Council authority

## <a id="core-principles"></a>Core Economic Integration Principles

The framework operates through three integrated levels using a single Hearts currency while respecting local autonomy:

### Nested Economic Systems Architecture

**Local: Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**
Communities form BAZs through practical 4-step process:
1. **Convening Circle**: Gather stakeholders and assess community readiness
2. **Proto-Treasury**: Establish Hearts allocation and management systems  
3. **Community Providers**: Charter local services accepting Hearts currency
4. **BAZ Council**: Formalize governance for Hearts economy management

BAZ Councils maintain authority over Community Provider chartering, Hearts treasury management, and cultural protocol enforcement while participating in global Hearts network.

**Regional: Voluntary Inter-BAZ Coordination**
- Universal Hearts currency eliminates exchange rate complexity
- 10% automatic solidarity redistribution supports under-resourced BAZs
- Regional crisis response and resource sharing through voluntary cooperation
- Cultural protocol respect in all inter-BAZ relationships

**Global: Social Resilience Council Coordination**
- Hearts currency technical standards and system integrity
- Crisis response coordination respecting community sovereignty
- Technology commons governance preventing corporate capture
- 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority

### Hearts Currency and Love Ledger Integration

**Single Hearts Currency**: Universal currency with global recognition enabling Elena's healthcare, Maya's restoration, and Joseph's cultural preservation to trade directly without conversion barriers.

**Community Provider System**: BAZ Councils charter local services to accept Hearts including healthcare, ecological restoration, education, cultural preservation, and community organizing.

**Love Ledger Parallel System**: Separate contribution tracking for informal care work, volunteer activities, and community relationship building without Hearts generation, providing recognition pathways to formal Hearts economy participation.

**AUBI Framework Coordination**: Hearts currency serves as primary mechanism for AUBI Framework v5.0 Layer 2 Contribution Bonuses, eliminating redundant systems while ensuring economic security foundation.
