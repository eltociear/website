## <a id="lmci-framework"></a>Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)

The LMCI provides holistic prosperity measurement replacing GDP's narrow focus on accumulation:

### Three-Pillar Assessment Framework

**Love: Hearts Transactions and Community Care (40% Weight)**:
Hearts currency circulation for caregiving, healthcare, community organizing, and mutual aid measured through transaction volume, Community Provider activity, and community validation of care quality. Love metrics demonstrate how Hearts economy creates wealth through healing relationships and community support rather than individual accumulation or market competition.

**Meaning: Cultural Vitality and Knowledge Transmission (30% Weight)**:
Cultural preservation, traditional knowledge sharing, artistic expression, and educational innovation tracked through Hearts payments and community recognition. Meaning metrics include language preservation programs, traditional knowledge transmission, ceremonial participation, and cultural innovation ensuring economic development serves community identity and intergenerational continuity.

**Connection: Ecological Stewardship and Social Networks (30% Weight)**:
Ecological restoration, biodiversity protection, community garden development, and social network strengthening measured through scientific monitoring, community participation, and mutual aid effectiveness. Connection metrics demonstrate how Hearts economy serves both environmental health and social cohesion through regenerative practices.

### Community-Centered Metric Development

**BAZ-Controlled Success Definitions**: Each BAZ defines LMCI components according to community values through participatory processes respecting diverse approaches to wellbeing and prosperity while maintaining regional coordination and comparative learning opportunities across different cultural contexts and traditional governance systems.

**Cultural Adaptation Requirements**: LMCI accommodates Indigenous seasonal calendars, traditional wealth concepts, religious community priorities, and diverse cultural practices ensuring evaluation strengthens rather than threatens community cultural identity while enabling cross-cultural learning and mutual support between different communities.

**Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Indigenous knowledge keepers and traditional authorities participate as equals in LMCI development ensuring traditional indicators of community health including spiritual wellbeing, territorial relationship, and seven-generation thinking inform evaluation alongside contemporary metrics and democratic participation measures.

**Youth and Elder Perspectives**: Evaluation includes formal input from both young people and elders ensuring assessment reflects contemporary needs and traditional wisdom while building intergenerational relationships and ensuring decisions serve both present community needs and future generations' wellbeing.

### LMCI vs GDP: Fundamental Reorientation

**Relationship Quality Over Transaction Volume**: While GDP measures monetary activity regardless of community impact, LMCI evaluates whether Hearts transactions strengthen community relationships, cultural practices, and ecological health demonstrating prosperity through care rather than accumulation.

**Regenerative Growth Recognition**: LMCI rewards activities that heal ecosystems and communities while GDP treats environmental destruction as economic gain when generating market activity. Hearts payments for restoration create positive LMCI indicators while destructive activities receive no recognition.

**Community Sovereignty Over Market Determination**: Unlike GDP reflecting market valuations controlled by wealth concentration, LMCI emerges from community-controlled processes recognizing care work, traditional knowledge, ecological stewardship, and community organizing that markets systematically undervalue or ignore completely.

**Holistic Prosperity Integration**: LMCI coordinates with other Global Governance Framework metrics including Biosphere Health Index from Planetary Health Framework ensuring community prosperity measurement serves rather than undermines planetary health through integrated evaluation and coordinated community development approaches.
