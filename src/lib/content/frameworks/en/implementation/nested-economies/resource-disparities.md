*Elena's clinic serves East Oakland where 40% of families live below the poverty line, while Marin County communities across the bay have median incomes exceeding $100,000. Maya coordinates restoration across counties where some communities can afford green infrastructure while others lack basic water treatment. Joseph's Anishinaabe community faces systematic underfunding while nearby suburbs enjoy well-funded schools. These resource disparities didn't emerge by accident—they result from centuries of extraction and discrimination that current systems perpetuate.*

*The Hearts currency addresses these disparities through automatic solidarity redistribution, Community Weaver support networks, and BAZ formation assistance that builds genuine capacity for autonomous prosperity rather than creating dependency relationships.*

## <a id="automatic-solidarity"></a>Automatic Solidarity Through Hearts Currency

The single Hearts currency includes built-in mechanisms that automatically address resource disparities without bureaucratic allocation processes:

### 10% Solidarity Redistribution System

**Automatic Resource Sharing**: Ten percent of all inter-BAZ Hearts trade automatically redistributes to under-resourced BAZs through algorithmic allocation based on community need indicators including population, income levels, infrastructure access, and historical disadvantage. This creates positive feedback loops where successful BAZs contribute to regional prosperity through increased trade activity.

**Transparent Allocation Algorithm**: Solidarity redistribution operates through public algorithms considering community size, economic indicators, infrastructure needs, and historical injustice factors while maintaining BAZ privacy and community control over resource utilization. Communities can track solidarity flows through Love Ledger transparency while maintaining sovereignty over how redistributed Hearts support local development.

**No Bureaucratic Applications**: Unlike traditional aid requiring complex applications and external approval, solidarity redistribution operates automatically based on objective indicators, eliminating bureaucratic barriers while ensuring resources reach communities most needing support for BAZ formation and Hearts economy development.

**Community-Controlled Utilization**: BAZs receiving solidarity funds maintain complete autonomy over resource use including Community Provider support, infrastructure development, capacity building, and crisis reserves while contributing to transparency and learning networks enabling other communities to learn from successful approaches.

### Under-Resourced BAZ Priority Support

**Startup Hearts Allocation**: Under-resourced communities receive enhanced startup Hearts allocation (up to 25,000 Hearts vs. standard 10,000) from Social Resilience Council enabling robust Community Provider networks and treasury operations while building community capacity for Hearts economy participation and autonomous prosperity development.
