## <a id="baz-formation-strategy"></a>BAZ Formation Strategy

BAZ formation follows a practical 4-step process that can be implemented by any community ready to participate in Hearts economy:

### Step 1: Convening Circle Formation

**Community Readiness Assessment**: Communities begin with simple 25-point assessment covering social cohesion (10 points), economic diversity (5 points), technical access (5 points), and cultural protocols (5 points). Score of 15+ indicates readiness to proceed, while lower scores identify capacity-building priorities.

**Stakeholder Engagement Protocol**: Convening Circles include 7-12 community members representing Indigenous voices, youth perspectives, elder wisdom, economic justice advocates, and potential Community Providers. Circle formation respects traditional governance while building bridges across community sectors.

**Initial Hearts Allocation Request**: Convening Circles submit simple application to Social Resilience Council for startup Hearts allocation (typically 10,000 Hearts) enabling immediate economic activity while community develops formal BAZ structure and Community Provider network.

**Cultural Protocol Integration**: Circle formation accommodates Indigenous consultation requirements, traditional decision-making processes, spiritual protocols, and seasonal calendars ensuring BAZ development strengthens rather than undermines existing community governance and cultural practices.

**Success Metrics**: 
- 80% Circle member retention through formation process
- Completion of 4-step process within 6 months
- Community endorsement of BAZ formation through culturally appropriate approval processes

### Step 2: Proto-Treasury Establishment  

**Hearts Treasury Setup**: Proto-Treasury begins with Social Resilience Council startup allocation managed through simple digital wallet system with multi-signature community control and transparent transaction tracking via Love Ledger integration for community oversight and accountability.

**Community Allocation Framework**: Proto-Treasury establishes allocation priorities including Community Provider startup funding (40%), community needs support (30%), solidarity fund contribution (20%), and emergency reserves (10%) based on community input and cultural priorities.

**Treasury Management Training**: Circle members receive basic Hearts currency management training through Community Weaver support including digital wallet operation, community decision-making processes, and financial transparency protocols without complex certification requirements.

**Community Oversight Development**: Proto-Treasury operates through monthly community reports, transparent decision-making, and feedback mechanisms building trust and capacity for democratic resource management while respecting diverse cultural approaches to consensus and accountability.

**Success Metrics**:
- Zero treasury mismanagement incidents
- 90% community approval of treasury decisions
- Successful support of 3+ Community Provider applications

### Step 3: Community Provider Chartering

**Service Assessment and Provider Identification**: Communities identify essential services that could accept Hearts payments including healthcare (Elena's clinic), ecological restoration (Maya's projects), education, food systems, housing, and cultural preservation based on community needs and existing service capacity.

**Charter Application Process**: Potential Community Providers submit applications including service description, community benefit plan, Hearts payment integration, and cultural protocol compliance. BAZ Circle reviews applications through community input process ensuring chartered services serve community priorities.

**Hearts Payment Integration**: Chartered providers integrate Hearts acceptance with existing payment systems through simple point-of-sale applications, invoice systems, or service exchange protocols enabling immediate Hearts circulation while maintaining service quality and community relationships.
