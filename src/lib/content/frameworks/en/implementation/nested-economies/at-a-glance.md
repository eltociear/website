# Nested Economies: At-a-Glance

*Building Economies of Right Relationship Through Single Hearts Currency*

## The Challenge We Face

Communities worldwide face an impossible choice: remain economically isolated and vulnerable, or integrate into systems that extract their wealth, exploit their labor, and erode their cultures.

- **$76 billion annually** extracted from local economies by chain retailers while small businesses struggle
- **$13 trillion care economy** remains invisible and unrewarded in traditional markets
- **Indigenous communities** face appropriation of traditional knowledge without consent or benefit
- **Climate crisis** demands cooperation, but current integration models sacrifice local autonomy for efficiency

## The Transformation We Need

**From:** Choose between economic isolation or exploitative integration  
**To:** Single currency cooperation that strengthens local sovereignty

## Core Innovation: Universal Hearts Currency + BAZ Formation

### 💚 **Hearts Currency**
Universal currency that rewards what traditional markets ignore:
- Caregiving and elder support across all communities
- Cultural preservation and language teaching globally
- Ecological restoration and climate action worldwide
- Community organizing and conflict resolution everywhere

### 📱 **Love Ledger**
Separate contribution tracking system for informal community work:
- Volunteer activities and mutual aid
- Family caregiving and community relationship building
- Cultural practices and traditional knowledge sharing
- Pathways to formal Hearts economy participation

### 🏘️ **BAZ Formation Process**
Practical 4-step pathway for community economic sovereignty:
1. **Convening Circle**: Gather stakeholders and assess readiness
2. **Proto-Treasury**: Establish Hearts allocation system
3. **Community Providers**: Charter local services accepting Hearts
4. **BAZ Council**: Formalize governance and regional connections

## Two Levels of Integration

### 🏘️ **Local: Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Control**
- BAZ Councils charter Community Providers and manage Hearts treasury
- Community assemblies provide democratic oversight and resource allocation
- Cultural protocols respected through BAZ-level adaptation and enforcement
- Community Provider networks covering healthcare, education, restoration, and culture

### 🌍 **Global: Social Resilience Council Coordination**
- Universal Hearts currency standards and technical infrastructure
- Crisis response coordination respecting community sovereignty
- Technology commons governance preventing corporate capture
- 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority

## Governance That Actually Works

### Community Providers
BAZ-chartered services accepting Hearts currency including Elena's healthcare clinic, Maya's restoration projects, and Joseph's traditional food systems—ensuring essential community services receive Hearts payments while maintaining quality and community benefit.

### Community Weavers  
Professional facilitators trained in Hearts mechanics, cultural protocols, and BAZ formation support with 6-month practical program and AUBI Layer 2 Hearts compensation ensuring authentic community participation.

### BAZ Councils vs Social Resilience Council
Clear authority division: BAZ Councils control local economics (Community Provider chartering, Hearts treasury, cultural protocols) while Social Resilience Council manages global coordination (Hearts standards, crisis response, technology commons).

## Implementation: Start Simple, Scale Carefully

### **Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Foundation**
- 10 BAZ pilots with $50M investment
- Train 100 Community Weavers with cultural competency
- Demonstrate 70% Hearts adoption and 85% community satisfaction
- **If pilots fail → stop, no wider rollout**

### **Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Regional Networks**  
- 25 BAZs across 5 bioregional networks
- Full AUBI Framework v5.0 coordination providing economic security
- 50% Hearts adoption with voluntary participation only
- **Multiple exit ramps for communities wanting different approaches**

### **Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Global Coordination**
- 100 BAZ networks with Indigenous leadership
- Social Resilience Council global Hearts standards management
- 80% reduction in wealth disparities between participating communities
- **Traditional economic systems remain fully available**

## What Makes This Different

### ❌ **Current Integration Models:**
- Force communities to abandon traditional governance for market participation
- Extract wealth from communities to distant shareholders through complex systems
- Override local democratic decisions through corporate trade agreements
- Concentrate power in unaccountable international institutions

### ✅ **Nested Economies:**
- **Community veto authority** through BAZ Councils over all local economic decisions
- **Wealth circulation** through single Hearts currency with 10% solidarity redistribution
- **Cultural sovereignty protection** with Indigenous Earth Council oversight and veto power
- **Democratic participation** through Community Provider chartering and transparent governance

## Evidence Base: Building on Proven Success

**Community Currencies:** Bristol Pound demonstrated 15% increase in local business revenue—Hearts eliminates currency conversion complexity  
**Resource Dividends:** Alaska Permanent Fund proves 40+ years of wealth sharing—Hearts integrates with AUBI Framework v5.0  
**Worker Cooperatives:** Mondragón Corporation: 70,000+ worker-owners—Hearts supports cooperative development  
**BAZ Formation:** Transition Towns movement shows community-led change—Hearts provides economic foundation

## Economic Security Through AUBI Integration

Rather than duplicating economic security systems, Hearts currency integrates with AUBI Framework v5.0:

### AUBI Layer 2 Integration
Hearts currency serves as primary mechanism for AUBI Contribution Bonuses recognizing care work, ecological restoration, cultural preservation validated through Community Provider system

### Economic Foundation
AUBI Framework provides:
- **Layer 1**: Universal baseline security ($500/month hybrid Hearts/fiat)
- **Layer 3**: Equity adjustments for historical injustices and marginalized communities  
- **Layer 4**: Global stabilization and crisis response coordination

## Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)

**Replacing GDP with what actually creates thriving communities:**
- **Love (40%):** Hearts transactions and community care activities
- **Meaning (30%):** Cultural vitality and traditional knowledge transmission  
- **Connection (30%):** Ecological stewardship and inter-BAZ cooperation

Community-controlled evaluation with cultural adaptation and traditional knowledge integration

## Crisis Response Capabilities

### **48-Hour Activation** through Social Resilience Council coordination
### **10% Solidarity Redistribution** automatic support for under-resourced BAZs
### **Community Sovereignty** maintained during crisis response
### **Traditional Knowledge Integration** for proven resilience strategies

## Integration with Global Governance

Nested Economies operates as the **economic integration specialist** within the broader Global Governance Framework:
- 🌍 **Treaty for Our Only Home** (environmental standards and enforcement)
- 🏛️ **Indigenous Governance** (traditional authority and cultural sovereignty)

**Phase 3:** $1B for global coordination (funded through AUBI Framework Automation Tax)

**Revenue Sources:** AUBI Framework coordination, 10% solidarity redistribution, Community Provider fees, cooperative enterprise development

## Why This Matters Now

**The Choice is Real:** Communities can either continue losing wealth to distant corporations while facing climate breakdown, or build cooperative relationships that keep resources local while addressing planetary challenges through single Hearts currency.

**The Technology Exists:** Hearts currency applications, Love Ledger platforms, and BAZ formation processes enable community-controlled economic systems at unprecedented scale with simplified implementation.

**The Movement is Growing:** From Indigenous sovereignty to cooperative enterprises to climate action, communities worldwide seek alternatives to extractive economic integration—Hearts currency provides practical pathway.

**Success Creates Success:** Each successful BAZ demonstrates that cooperation can compete with exploitation, inspiring broader adoption while maintaining community choice and cultural sovereignty.

## The Future We Choose

**Current Path:** Economic colonialism extracting wealth from communities, climate crisis accelerating while solutions are blocked by corporate interests, democratic erosion through economic concentration.

**Nested Economies Path:** Communities cooperating through single Hearts currency by choice not force, economic security enabling creativity and care through AUBI integration, Indigenous sovereignty strengthened through Earth Council authority, planetary challenges addressed through democratic Social Resilience Council coordination.

**The transformation from extraction to Right Relationship begins with each community that chooses BAZ formation, each Hearts transaction that keeps wealth local, each person who values care over accumulation.**

**We have the tools. We have the evidence. We have the choice.**

**The economics of Right Relationship begin now.**
