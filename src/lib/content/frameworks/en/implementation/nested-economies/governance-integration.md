*Elena's clinic needs Hearts currency acceptance approved by her BAZ Council, which charters Community Providers and manages local economic decisions. Maya's multi-BAZ restoration work coordinates through standardized Hearts protocols overseen by the Social Resilience Council, which maintains global Hearts currency integrity. Joseph's community maintains cultural sovereignty through their BAZ Council while participating in the global Hearts network. This clear division - BAZ Councils for local control, Social Resilience Council for global standards - eliminates complex intermediate governance while preserving both community autonomy and system coordination.*

## <a id="simplified-governance"></a>Simplified Governance Architecture

The governance system operates through clear two-tier structure eliminating complex bioregional intermediate layers:

### Two-Tier System Design

**Local BAZ Councils**: Each Bioregional Autonomous Zone maintains its own council with authority over Community Provider chartering, Hearts treasury management, cultural protocol enforcement, and local economic priorities. Elena's clinic gets chartered by her BAZ Council, Joseph's traditional food systems operate under his community's BAZ Council authority.

**Global Social Resilience Council**: Single global coordination body manages Hearts currency technical standards, inter-BAZ exchange protocols, crisis response coordination, and technology commons governance while maintaining 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority over decisions affecting Indigenous sovereignty.

**No Intermediate Bioregional Governance**: Unlike previous complex models, communities coordinate directly through standardized Hearts protocols rather than imposed bioregional authorities, achieving cooperation through voluntary exchange and automatic solidarity redistribution rather than governance hierarchy.

**Clear Authority Division**: BAZ Councils control local economic decisions while Social Resilience Council maintains system integrity, preventing conflicts over jurisdiction while enabling both community autonomy and global coordination through clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

### Cultural Sovereignty Protection

**Indigenous Earth Council Ultimate Authority**: Earth Council maintains veto power over any Social Resilience Council decisions affecting Indigenous sovereignty, traditional territories, or cultural practices, ensuring global coordination serves rather than threatens Indigenous communities and traditional governance systems.

**Traditional Governance Integration**: BAZ Councils accommodate Indigenous consensus processes, elder authority, ceremonial requirements, and traditional law while participating in standardized Hearts systems, ensuring economic participation strengthens rather than undermines traditional governance and cultural practices.

**Cultural Protocol Enforcement**: BAZ Councils maintain authority over cultural adaptation of Hearts systems, Community Provider requirements, and economic activities ensuring participation respects traditional knowledge, spiritual obligations, and community values while maintaining system interoperability.

**Anti-Appropriation Safeguards**: Both BAZ and Social Resilience Councils include explicit protections against traditional knowledge extraction, cultural appropriation, and spiritual exploitation while supporting beneficial knowledge sharing through community-controlled protocols and ongoing consent verification.

### Democratic Accountability Mechanisms

**Community Assembly Oversight**: BAZ Councils remain accountable to community assemblies through monthly meetings, transparent decision-making, and regular evaluation ensuring democratic control over local economic decisions while building community capacity for self-governance and economic sovereignty.

**Social Resilience Council Representation**: Global council includes delegates from BAZ Councils, Indigenous nations, and civil society organizations with rotating leadership and term limits preventing concentration of power while ensuring grassroots input in global coordination decisions.

**Transparent Decision-Making**: All governance decisions receive public documentation with community access enabling oversight while protecting privacy and cultural protocols, ensuring accountability without harmful exposure or violation of traditional knowledge protection requirements.

**Regular Review and Renewal**: Governance structures require periodic reauthorization through community approval ensuring continued legitimacy while enabling adaptation to changing needs and evolving community priorities without disrupting essential coordination functions.

## <a id="council-roles"></a>BAZ Council vs Social Resilience Council Roles

Clear role division prevents jurisdictional conflicts while enabling effective coordination:
