*Elena runs her community health clinic and wants to accept a currency that values care work. Maya coordinates watershed restoration across multiple communities and needs a way to track ecological contributions. Joseph's Anishinaabe community seeks economic participation while maintaining sovereignty. Rather than requiring each community to create complex local currency systems, they can all participate in a single Hearts currency that recognizes their diverse contributions while maintaining their autonomy through Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).*

## <a id="nested-systems-architecture"></a>Nested Economic Systems Architecture

The framework operates through three integrated levels that use a single Hearts currency while respecting local autonomy:

### Local Level: Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)

**BAZ Formation Process**: Communities form BAZs through a simple 4-step process:
1. **Convening Circle**: Gather interested community members and stakeholders
2. **Proto-Treasury**: Establish initial Hearts allocation and management system
3. **Community Providers**: Charter local services that accept Hearts currency
4. **BAZ Council**: Formalize local governance for Hearts economy management

**Hearts Treasury Management**: Each BAZ operates a Hearts Treasury (`mechanism_hearts_treasury`) that manages local Hearts allocation, Community Provider chartering, and resource distribution while connecting to the global Hearts network through standardized protocols.

**Community Provider System**: Local services including healthcare (Elena's clinic), ecological restoration (Maya's projects), and cultural preservation (Joseph's traditional foods) receive Community Provider charters from their BAZ Council, enabling them to accept Hearts payments for verified community contributions.

**Local Autonomy**: BAZ Councils maintain full authority over Community Provider chartering, local Hearts allocation priorities, and cultural adaptation of Hearts systems while participating in the global Hearts economy through standardized exchange protocols.

### Regional Level: Inter-BAZ Coordination

**Hearts-Based Trade Networks**: BAZs coordinate through standardized Hearts currency rather than complex local currency exchange systems. Maya's restoration work can serve multiple BAZs using the same Hearts currency, eliminating exchange rate complexity while maintaining regional cooperation.

**10% Solidarity Redistribution**: Automated system redistributes 10% of inter-BAZ Hearts trade to under-resourced BAZs through transparent allocation algorithms, creating positive feedback loops for mutual support without complex regional governance structures.

**Bioregional Resource Sharing**: BAZs within watersheds coordinate resource management, infrastructure development, and crisis response through Hearts-based incentives and voluntary cooperation rather than imposed bioregional governance structures.

**Cultural Protocol Respect**: Regional coordination accommodates Indigenous territorial sovereignty, traditional governance systems, and cultural practices through BAZ-controlled participation rather than external bioregional authorities overriding local autonomy.

### Global Level: Simplified Commons Governance

**Social Resilience Council Authority**: Single global coordination body manages Hearts currency standards, inter-BAZ protocols, and crisis response coordination while maintaining 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority over decisions affecting Indigenous sovereignty.

**Global Commons Fund**: Funded through Automation Tax and Resource Taxes as detailed in the AUBI Framework v5.0, supporting crisis response, technology commons, and global coordination without duplicating AUBI architecture in this economic framework.

**Technology Commons**: Open-source Hearts currency software, Love Ledger platforms, and coordination tools remain under community control through distributed development and BAZ Council oversight rather than corporate ownership.

**Treaty Integration**: Coordination with Treaty for Our Only Home enforcement mechanisms enables carbon-neutral trade standards and ecological protection requirements through Hearts currency incentives rather than separate regulatory systems.

## <a id="hearts-global-currency"></a>Hearts as Global Coordinating Currency

Hearts operates as a single global currency that recognizes diverse community contributions while enabling seamless coordination:

### Single Currency Architecture

**Universal Hearts Standard**: Unlike complex local currency systems, Hearts provides a single unit of account that all BAZs can use for trade, contribution recognition, and resource sharing, eliminating exchange rate complexity and enabling true interoperability.

**Community Provider Recognition**: Elena's healthcare work, Maya's ecological restoration, and Joseph's cultural preservation all receive Hearts payments using the same currency, enabling them to trade with each other directly without currency conversion barriers.

**Standardized Validation**: Hearts currency uses consistent Proof of Care validation protocols across all BAZs, ensuring that care work, ecological contributions, and cultural preservation receive fair recognition regardless of local economic conditions or cultural differences.

**Global Circulation**: Hearts earned in one BAZ can be spent in any other BAZ, enabling community members to travel, relocate, or support distant communities while maintaining their Hearts-based economic relationships and contribution recognition.

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Fiat Bridge Mechanisms**: Hearts currency connects to traditional financial systems through Heartstarter programs (1:1 fiat donation matching) and cooperative enterprise integration, enabling gradual transition rather than requiring immediate abandonment of existing economic relationships.

**AUBI Framework Integration**: Hearts currency operates as the contribution recognition mechanism within the four-layered AUBI system detailed in AUBI Framework v5.0, eliminating redundancy while ensuring economic security and community contribution recognition work together seamlessly.

**Cooperative Enterprise Support**: Worker cooperatives, housing cooperatives, and community enterprises can accept Hearts payments while maintaining traditional financial relationships, building alternative economic capacity without creating unsustainable parallel systems.

**Legal Framework Compatibility**: Hearts currency operates within existing legal frameworks through community service exchange and gift economy protocols while advocating for supportive legislation through demonstrated beneficial outcomes rather than regulatory confrontation.

## <a id="love-ledger-tracking"></a>Love Ledger as Parallel Contribution Tracking

Love Ledger operates as a separate system tracking informal contributions that complement but don't directly create Hearts currency:

### Informal Contribution Recognition

**Care Work Documentation**: Love Ledger tracks unpaid care work including family caregiving, community organizing, volunteer activities, and mutual aid that doesn't generate Hearts payments but creates valuable community impact and relationship building.

**Ecological Stewardship Recording**: Individual and community ecological contributions including home composting, community gardening, habitat restoration, and sustainable lifestyle choices receive Love Ledger recognition without requiring formal Community Provider status.

**Cultural Preservation Tracking**: Traditional knowledge transmission, language teaching, storytelling, artistic creation, and ceremonial leadership receive Love Ledger documentation, honoring cultural work while respecting sacred knowledge boundaries and traditional authority systems.

**Community Relationship Building**: Conflict resolution, mentorship, neighborly support, and community celebration activities receive Love Ledger recognition, making visible the relationship work that sustains community cohesion and enables formal Hearts economy success.

### Separate but Complementary System

**Non-Monetary Recognition**: Love Ledger provides recognition and community appreciation without direct Hearts currency generation, preventing inflation while honoring essential unpaid work that enables paid community contributions.

**Community Validation Networks**: Love Ledger entries receive community validation through peer recognition and recipient feedback rather than formal Proof of Care processes, maintaining informal character while preventing gaming and ensuring authenticity.

**Privacy and Consent Controls**: Love Ledger participants control their contribution visibility from completely private to community-shared to public recognition, respecting diverse cultural approaches to recognition and preventing unwanted exposure or cultural protocol violations.

**Bridge to Hearts Economy**: Outstanding Love Ledger contributors may receive Community Provider opportunities or Hearts economy roles, providing pathways for increased community economic participation while respecting individual choice and community selection processes.

## <a id="resource-justice-aubi"></a>Resource Justice Through AUBI Integration

Resource justice operates primarily through the four-layered AUBI system detailed in AUBI Framework v5.0:

### Cross-Framework Integration

**AUBI Framework Coordination**: Rather than duplicating AUBI architecture, this framework coordinates with AUBI Framework v5.0 to ensure Hearts currency recognition integrates seamlessly with universal baseline income, contribution bonuses, equity adjustments, and global stabilization mechanisms.

**Hearts as AUBI Layer 2**: Hearts currency serves as the primary mechanism for AUBI Layer 2 Contribution Bonuses, rewarding verified community care work, ecological restoration, and cultural preservation through Hearts payments that supplement universal baseline income.

**Leaves Token Integration**: AUBI Leaves tokens for ecological restoration integrate with Green Job Score multipliers (1.0x-1.5x) validated by the Fractal Labor Parliament, creating economic incentives for environmental stewardship while maintaining standardized contribution recognition across all BAZs.

**Equity Through BAZ Support**: AUBI Layer 3 Equity Adjustments support under-resourced BAZs through additional Hearts allocation and technical assistance, addressing historical injustices and geographic disparities without creating separate equity bureaucracies within the economic framework.

### Simplified Resource Distribution

**10% Solidarity Redistribution**: Automated redistribution of 10% of inter-BAZ Hearts trade to under-resourced BAZs provides immediate resource sharing without complex needs assessment or bureaucratic allocation processes, creating positive feedback loops for mutual support.

**Crisis Response Coordination**: AUBI Layer 4 Global Stabilization mechanisms provide crisis response funding and coordination through the Social Resilience Council, enabling rapid assistance during emergencies while maintaining BAZ autonomy over assistance acceptance and resource utilization.

**Commons Funding Integration**: Global Commons Fund established through Automation Tax and Resource Tax collection (detailed in AUBI Framework) supports technology commons, crisis response, and coordination infrastructure without requiring separate funding mechanisms or taxation systems.

**Anti-Exploitation Safeguards**: Wealth concentration limits, speculation prevention, and community veto authority operate through Hearts currency design and AUBI Framework protections rather than separate regulatory systems, maintaining community economic sovereignty while preventing exploitation.

## <a id="baz-formation"></a>Bioregional Autonomous Zone Formation

BAZ formation follows a practical 4-step process rather than complex theoretical governance development:

### Step 1: Convening Circle Formation

**Initial Community Gathering**: Interested community members including potential Community Providers, traditional authorities, and economic justice advocates form initial planning circle to assess community readiness and interest in Hearts economy participation.

**Cultural Protocol Integration**: Convening Circle respects Indigenous governance systems, traditional authority structures, and cultural decision-making processes, ensuring BAZ formation strengthens rather than undermines existing community leadership and cultural practices.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Circle includes diverse community representation across age, culture, economic status, and community role ensuring Hearts economy serves broad community needs rather than narrow interests while maintaining manageable decision-making group size.

**Vision and Values Alignment**: Circle develops shared understanding of Right Relationship principles, community economic priorities, and cultural adaptation requirements ensuring BAZ formation aligns with community values and traditional knowledge systems.

### Step 2: Proto-Treasury Establishment

**Initial Hearts Allocation**: Community receives startup Hearts allocation through Social Resilience Council coordination, enabling immediate economic activity while building community capacity for Hearts Treasury management and Community Provider support.

**Treasury Management Training**: Circle receives training in Hearts currency management, community allocation processes, and financial transparency protocols through Community Weaver support and peer learning networks rather than complex certification programs.

**Resource Allocation Planning**: Proto-Treasury establishes initial priorities for Hearts distribution including Community Provider support, community needs assessment, and crisis response reserves based on community input and cultural protocol requirements.

**Transparency and Accountability**: Proto-Treasury operates through community oversight, regular reporting, and transparent decision-making processes ensuring community control over Hearts allocation while building trust and capacity for formal Treasury operations.

### Step 3: Community Provider Chartering

**Service Provider Identification**: Community identifies essential services including healthcare, education, ecological restoration, cultural preservation, and community organizing that could accept Hearts payments while serving community needs and values.

**Charter Application Process**: Potential Community Providers apply for BAZ Council charter through community review process including service plan, community benefit assessment, and cultural protocol compliance ensuring chartered services serve community rather than individual profit.

**Hearts Payment Integration**: Chartered Community Providers integrate Hearts currency acceptance with existing service provision, enabling community members to pay for services through Hearts earned via community contributions while maintaining service quality and accessibility.

**Quality and Community Benefit Monitoring**: Chartered Community Providers receive ongoing community evaluation and feedback ensuring services continue meeting community needs while respecting cultural protocols and maintaining Hearts economy integrity through community oversight.

### Step 4: BAZ Council Formalization

**Democratic Council Selection**: Community selects BAZ Council through culturally appropriate processes including election, consensus selection, traditional appointment, or hybrid approaches respecting diverse governance traditions while ensuring community representation and accountability.

**Council Authority and Responsibility**: BAZ Council receives authority over Community Provider chartering, Hearts Treasury management, inter-BAZ coordination, and cultural protocol enforcement while remaining accountable to community through regular review and feedback processes.

**Regional Network Connection**: Formalized BAZ connects to regional Hearts networks enabling inter-BAZ trade, solidarity fund participation, and mutual aid coordination while maintaining local autonomy over participation levels and economic priorities.

**Ongoing Development and Adaptation**: BAZ Council facilitates ongoing community engagement, system refinement, and cultural adaptation ensuring Hearts economy continues serving community needs while maintaining connection to broader economic transformation movement.

## <a id="governance-simplification"></a>Governance Simplification and Council Roles

Governance operates through clear division between global coordination and local autonomy:

### Social Resilience Council (Global Level)

**Hearts Currency Standards**: Social Resilience Council maintains Hearts currency technical standards, Proof of Care validation protocols, and inter-BAZ exchange mechanisms ensuring system integrity while preserving BAZ autonomy over local allocation and cultural adaptation.

**Crisis Response Coordination**: Council coordinates emergency assistance, resource mobilization, and mutual aid deployment during natural disasters, economic emergencies, and health crises while respecting BAZ sovereignty over assistance acceptance and resource utilization decisions.

**Technology Commons Governance**: Council oversees open-source Hearts currency software, Love Ledger platform development, and coordination tools ensuring community control over essential infrastructure while preventing corporate capture or technological dependence.

**Indigenous Authority Recognition**: 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority ensure global coordination strengthens rather than undermines Indigenous sovereignty, traditional governance systems, and territorial rights while supporting decolonization and cultural preservation efforts.

### BAZ Councils (Local Level)

**Community Provider Management**: BAZ Councils charter local Community Providers, monitor service quality, and ensure Hearts acceptance meets community needs while respecting cultural protocols and maintaining community benefit focus rather than profit maximization.

**Hearts Treasury Operations**: Councils manage local Hearts allocation including Community Provider support, community needs funding, solidarity fund contribution, and crisis response reserves through transparent processes and community accountability mechanisms.

**Cultural Protocol Enforcement**: Councils ensure Hearts economy implementation respects traditional governance, ceremonial requirements, spiritual obligations, and cultural practices while adapting systems to serve community identity and intergenerational continuity.

**Regional Coordination Participation**: Councils determine BAZ participation levels in inter-BAZ trade, solidarity redistribution, and mutual aid networks while maintaining community sovereignty over economic relationships and development priorities.

### Simplified Decision-Making Matrix

| Level | Authority | Currency Management | Oversight Body |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Local BAZ** | Community Provider chartering, local Hearts allocation | BAZ Hearts Treasury | Community assemblies, traditional authorities |
| **Regional** | Inter-BAZ trade facilitation, solidarity redistribution | Automated 10% redistribution | BAZ Council coordination |
| **Global** | Hearts standards, crisis coordination, technology commons | Social Resilience Council oversight | Earth Council veto authority |

This simplified structure eliminates complex bioregional governance layers while maintaining effective coordination through voluntary cooperation and automated resource sharing mechanisms.
