## 🛠️ 4 Big Changes to Make a Difference

### 1️⃣ 💸 Shift the Money

**Move money from harmful farming to helpful farming**

* Fund tools like water-saving systems & soil care.
* Example: Costa Rica gave farmers money to protect forests 🌳

### 2️⃣ 📚 Share the Knowledge

**Make sure farmers can learn from each other**

* Use community apps, SMS, radio, and local storytelling.
* Combine traditional wisdom with new tech.
* Example: Kenyan farmers used SMS to grow more milk 🐄📲

### 3️⃣ 🧭 Same Rules, Fair Rules

**Get countries to agree on good food policies**

* Work together with the UN and others on shared rules.

* Example: African countries united to improve food policies 🌍

### 4️⃣ 🤲 Community Leadership
