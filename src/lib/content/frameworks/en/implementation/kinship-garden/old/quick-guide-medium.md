The *Lite Guide to the Food and Agriculture Framework* is a short and user-friendly introduction to the **Food and Agriculture Framework**, designed for farmers, Indigenous peoples, youth, NGOs, local authorities, and anyone looking to improve food systems. It summarizes the framework’s key ideas and provides simple steps to start making a difference in your community. The guide aligns with the Global Goals (SDGs) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), encouraging you to join the movement for sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems by 2035. It is part of the [Seed Starter Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and complements the framework’s [Introduction](/frameworks/food-systems-and-agriculture#introduction).  

## What is the framework?  

The *Food and Agriculture Framework* is a plan to improve food systems—how we grow, share, and eat food—for people and the planet. It focuses on:  

* **Sustainability**: Growing food in ways that benefit the environment, such as regenerative agriculture.  
* **Equity**: Ensuring everyone, especially Indigenous peoples, women, and youth, shares in the benefits.  
* **Resilience**: Building food systems that can withstand challenges like climate change or conflicts.  

**Major goals by 2035:**  

* Halve global hunger.  
* Make 30% of agricultural land regenerative (eco-friendly).  
* Train 5 million farmers, including in Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).  

*Plain-language explanation*: This is a plan to grow food in a way that’s good for the Earth, fair for everyone, and ready for tough times—with goals like reducing hunger and greening agriculture.  

**Aligned with**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).  

## Why it matters  

Food affects everything—our health, environment, culture, and economy. But today’s food systems often harm nature, deepen inequalities, and leave many hungry. We can change this.  

*Plain-language explanation*: Food is more than nutrition—it’s about how we treat each other and the planet.
