The *Policy Harmonization Toolkit* is a practical guide to assist stakeholders—policymakers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), farmers’ associations, indigenous communities, and private sectors—in aligning national and regional policies with the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. By fostering policy reforms that support sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems, this toolkit advances the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives), such as redirecting 40% of agricultural subsidies to regenerative practices by 2030. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, it provides tools for policy assessment, stakeholder engagement, and advocacy. This toolkit is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and supports the framework’s [Policy Development](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms) goals.

## Overview
The toolkit equips stakeholders to:
- Assess existing policies for alignment with framework goals.
- Engage diverse stakeholders to co-design policy reforms.
- Use model legislation to guide subsidy redirection, fair trade, and smallholder protections.
- Advocate for policy adoption at local, national, and global levels.
- Monitor and evaluate policy alignment to ensure accountability.

This tool supports the framework’s aim to harmonize policies across 50 countries by 2028, ensuring a cohesive global approach to sustainable food systems.

*Accessible explanation*: This guide helps you check and change rules in your area to support better food systems, like funding green farming, by working together and using example laws.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

## Policy Assessment
**Purpose**: Evaluate current policies to identify gaps and opportunities for alignment with the framework.

**Steps**:
- **Inventory Policies**: Compile a list of existing agricultural, trade, and environmental policies in [Region/Country], focusing on subsidies, land use, and trade regulations.
- **Alignment Check**: Compare policies against framework goals using the checklist below, scoring each from 0–3 (0: No alignment, 3: Full alignment).
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify misalignments (e.g., subsidies favoring industrial farming) and opportunities (e.g., existing biodiversity programs).
- **Report Findings**: Summarize results in a [e.g., 5-page report] to share with stakeholders by [Date, e.g., Q2 2025].

**Checklist**:
| Policy Area | Alignment Question | Score (0–3) |
|-------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Subsidies | Do policies incentivize regenerative or agroecological practices? | |
| Trade | Are there protections for smallholder farmers in trade agreements? | |
| Land Use | Do policies support sustainable land management and indigenous rights? | |
| Climate | Are policies aligned with Paris Agreement commitments? | |

**Example**:
- In [Country], a policy assessment reveals subsidies favor monoculture, scoring 1 for alignment. The gap analysis recommends redirecting funds to regenerative practices.

*Accessible explanation*: List your area’s rules, check if they support the plan’s goals, and note what needs to change.

**Alignment**: Supports [Systemic Leverage Points](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#09-systemic-leverage-points).

## Stakeholder Engagement for Policy Reform
**Purpose**: Involve diverse stakeholders to co-design and support policy changes, as outlined in [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement).

**Strategies**:
- **Convene Workshops**: Organize [e.g., 2–3] policy harmonization workshops by [Date, e.g., Q3 2025], engaging [e.g., farmers, indigenous leaders, policymakers].
- **Co-Governance**: Ensure [e.g., 50%] representation from marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous, women, youth) in policy task forces.
- **Build Coalitions**: Partner with [e.g., FAO, Fairtrade International] to strengthen advocacy, targeting [e.g., 5] partnerships by [Year, e.g., 2026].
- **Public Consultations**: Hold [e.g., 10] community forums to gather input on policy reforms, ensuring accessibility (e.g., multilingual materials).

**Example**:
- A workshop in [Region] engages 30 stakeholders, including indigenous farmers, to draft a subsidy reform proposal, adopted by local government.

*Accessible explanation*: Meet with farmers, community leaders, and others to plan rule changes together, making sure everyone has a say.

**Alignment**: Supports [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles).

## Model Legislation Templates
**Purpose**: Provide customizable policy templates to guide reforms in key areas.

**Templates**:
- **Subsidy Redirection**:
  - **Objective**: Redirect [e.g., 40%] of agricultural subsidies to regenerative practices by [Year, e.g., 2030].
  - **Key Provisions**: Offer tax breaks for [e.g., cover cropping, agroforestry]; phase out subsidies for [e.g., chemical fertilizers] by [Year].
  - **Example Clause**: “The Ministry of Agriculture shall allocate [X%] of annual subsidies to farmers adopting regenerative practices, verified by [certification body].”
- **Fair Trade Protections**:
  - **Objective**: Reduce trade barriers for smallholder farmers by [e.g., 15%] by [Year, e.g., 2030].
  - **Key Provisions**: Establish fair trade certification for [e.g., 50%] of agricultural exports; provide market access grants for smallholders.
  - **Example Clause**: “The Trade Department shall prioritize smallholder products in international trade agreements, ensuring [X%] tariff reductions.”
- **Indigenous Land Rights**:
  - **Objective**: Protect indigenous land rights per UNDRIP by [Year, e.g., 2028].
  - **Key Provisions**: Recognize indigenous land tenure; integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into land use policies.
  - **Example Clause**: “Land use policies shall respect indigenous governance, incorporating TEK in [X%] of agricultural planning.”

**Customization**:
- Adapt templates to [Region/Country] legal frameworks, consulting [e.g., local legal experts, indigenous councils] by [Date, e.g., Q4 2025].

*Accessible explanation*: Use example laws to create rules that fund green farming, help small farmers sell products, and protect indigenous lands.

**Alignment**: Supports [Policy Development](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

## Advocacy Strategies for Policy Adoption
**Purpose**: Mobilize support to ensure policies are adopted, as outlined in [Communication and Advocacy](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#13-communication-advocacy).

**Strategies**:
- **Policy Briefs**: Develop [e.g., 5] data-driven briefs by [Year, e.g., 2026], highlighting benefits (e.g., hunger reduction, carbon sequestration) for policymakers.
- **Global Forum Advocacy**: Present model legislation at [e.g., UN Food Systems Summit, COP] annually, targeting [e.g., 50] country commitments by [Year, e.g., 2028].
- **Grassroots Campaigns**: Launch [e.g., 20] community petitions or rallies by [Year, e.g., 2027], engaging [e.g., 5,000] supporters to pressure governments.
- **Media Engagement**: Publish [e.g., 10] op-eds and [e.g., 50] social media posts by [Year, e.g., 2026] to build public support, using hashtags like #FoodSystemsFuture.
- **Youth-Led Advocacy**: Train [e.g., 1,000] youth advocates by [Year, e.g., 2026] to lead campaigns, focusing on social media and local events.

**Example**:
- A youth-led petition in [Country] gains 3,000 signatures, urging subsidy redirection, presented at a national agricultural summit.

*Accessible explanation*: Share facts, talk at big meetings, get communities to sign petitions, and use media to convince leaders to adopt new rules.

**Alignment**: Supports [Advocacy Playbook](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/advocacy-playbook-en.md).

## Monitoring Policy Alignment
**Purpose**: Track and evaluate policy reforms to ensure accountability, as per [Monitoring and Evaluation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

**Monitoring Plan**:
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
  - Quantitative: [e.g., Percentage of subsidies redirected to regenerative practices (Target: 20% by 2028)].
  - Qualitative: [e.g., Stakeholder trust in policy processes (Target: 80% satisfaction by 2028 via surveys)].
- **Data Collection**: Conduct [e.g., annual] policy audits by [e.g., independent body, local NGOs], reviewing [e.g., subsidy budgets, trade agreements].
- **Reporting**: Publish results on [e.g., biannual dashboards, globalgovernanceframework.org], ensuring accessibility (e.g., plain-language summaries).
- **Review**: Hold [e.g., annual] stakeholder reviews to refine advocacy strategies, incorporating [e.g., 50%] input from marginalized groups.

**Example**:
- An audit in [Country] shows 15% subsidy redirection by 2027, prompting a new advocacy campaign to reach 20% by 2028.

*Accessible explanation*: Check if new rules are working by counting changes and asking people’s opinions, then share results to keep improving.
