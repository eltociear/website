The *Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template* is a customizable tool to help stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—track and assess the progress and impact of initiatives under the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. By defining objectives, selecting measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and establishing evaluation methods, this rubric ensures projects align with the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives) and [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency. Designed for pilot projects or broader initiatives, it is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and supports the framework’s [Monitoring and Evaluation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms) goals.

## Overview
The rubric provides a structured framework to:
- Clarify project objectives and their alignment with the framework.
- Define quantitative and qualitative KPIs to measure success.
- Outline methods for data collection and evaluation.
- Establish processes for reporting outcomes and adapting strategies.
- Ensure accountability and inclusivity in monitoring efforts.

This tool supports the framework’s commitment to tracking progress, such as achieving 30% regenerative farmland by 2035 and reducing hunger by 50% by 2030, while incorporating community feedback to ensure cultural and ecological relevance.

*Accessible explanation*: This template helps you check how your project is doing, like if you’re growing more food or helping the environment, by setting goals and measuring progress.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 15 (Life on Land), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Template**: Replace placeholders (e.g., [Project Name], [Region]) with details specific to your initiative.
2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve all relevant stakeholders, including indigenous communities and marginalized groups, to co-design objectives and KPIs.
3. **Complete Sections**: Fill in each section, ensuring KPIs are measurable and evaluation methods are feasible for your context.
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Collect data regularly and document findings, sharing results with stakeholders via [e.g., community meetings, globalgovernanceframework.org].
5. **Review and Adapt**: Conduct periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly, annually) to assess outcomes and adjust strategies based on findings.

*Accessible explanation*: Fill in the blanks for your project, work with your team to set goals, check progress often, share results, and make changes if needed.

## Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template
### Project Objectives
**Purpose**: Define the specific goals of your initiative, aligning with the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives).

**Objectives**:
- [Objective 1, e.g., Increase local food access by 20% in [Region] by [Year]].
- [Objective 2, e.g., Train 100 farmers in regenerative practices in [Region] by [Year]].
- [Objective 3, e.g., Integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into 2 farming practices by [Year]].

**Alignment with Framework**:
- [e.g., Objective 1 supports enhancing food security (SDG 2)].
- [e.g., Objective 2 supports promoting sustainable practices (SDG 15)].
- [e.g., Objective 3 supports UNDRIP and equity (SDG 10)].

*Accessible explanation*: List what your project aims to do, like feeding more people or teaching eco-friendly farming, and how it fits the bigger plan.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
**Purpose**: Select measurable indicators to track progress toward objectives, as outlined in [Monitoring and Evaluation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

**KPIs**:
- **Quantitative**:
  - [KPI 1, e.g., Number of households with improved food access (Target: 100 by [Year])].
  - [KPI 2, e.g., Hectares of farmland using regenerative practices (Target: 50 by [Year])].
  - [KPI 3, e.g., Number of farmers trained in TEK (Target: 100 by [Year])].
- **Qualitative**:
  - [KPI 4, e.g., Community satisfaction with project outcomes (Target: 80% approval via surveys by [Year])].
  - [KPI 5, e.g., Cultural preservation of TEK practices (Target: 2 practices documented by [Year])].

*Accessible explanation*: Choose ways to measure success, like counting people fed or asking if the community is happy with the project.

### Evaluation Methods
**Purpose**: Define how data will be collected and analyzed to assess KPIs.

**Methods**:
- **Quantitative**:
  - [Method 1, e.g., Monthly surveys to track household food access, conducted by local coordinators].
  - [Method 2, e.g., Satellite imagery or field measurements to monitor regenerative farmland].
  - [Method 3, e.g., Training attendance records to count TEK-trained farmers].
- **Qualitative**:
  - [Method 4, e.g., Focus groups with 10–20 community members to assess satisfaction].
  - [Method 5, e.g., Interviews with indigenous elders to document TEK practices].
- **Frequency**: Collect data [e.g., monthly, quarterly] and evaluate [e.g., biannually, annually].

**Resources Needed**:
- [e.g., Survey tools, local facilitators, data platform access].
- [e.g., Partnerships with NGOs for qualitative data collection].

*Accessible explanation*: Decide how to gather information, like asking people questions or checking fields, and how often to do it.

### Data Collection and Reporting
**Purpose**: Establish processes for collecting, storing, and sharing evaluation data.

**Plan**:
- **Collection**: Assign [e.g., community volunteers, project coordinators] to collect data using [e.g., paper forms, mobile apps].
- **Storage**: Store data securely on [e.g., local servers, globalgovernanceframework.org platform], respecting data sovereignty for indigenous communities.
- **Reporting**: Share findings via [e.g., quarterly community meetings, annual reports], ensuring accessibility (e.g., multilingual summaries, audio formats).
- **Transparency**: Publish outcomes on [e.g., public dashboards, community boards] to maintain trust, as per [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles).

**Example**:
- A pilot in [Region] reports 75% community satisfaction via a public dashboard, shared in English and [local language].

*Accessible explanation*: Plan who collects and keeps track of information, then share results openly with everyone.

### Review and Adaptation
**Purpose**: Use evaluation findings to refine and improve the initiative.

**Process**:
- **Review Schedule**: Conduct reviews [e.g., quarterly, annually] with [e.g., steering committee, indigenous leaders] to assess KPI progress.
- **Adaptation**: Adjust strategies based on findings, such as [e.g., increasing training sessions if farmer engagement is low].
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate stakeholder input, targeting [e.g., 50%] representation from marginalized groups, to ensure inclusivity.
- **Documentation**: Record changes in a [e.g., project log, annual report] to track evolution and inform scalability.

**Example**:
- A project in [Region] increases TEK workshops from 2 to 4 per year after a review shows only 60% farmer training targets met.

*Accessible explanation*: Regularly check how things are going, make changes if needed, and write down what you learn to do better.
