# Food Systems & Agriculture Framework: Timeline and Milestones

**In this section:**
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Year 1 (2025)](#year-1-2025)
- [Year 2 (2026)](#year-2-2026)
- [Year 3 (2027)](#year-3-2027)

- [Year 5 (2029)](#year-5-2029)

The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* outlines a five-year timeline (2025–2029) to initiate and scale its transformative vision for resilient, equitable, and sustainable global food systems. This section details key milestones for each year, providing a clear roadmap for stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors—to track progress and ensure accountability. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, the timeline supports the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/food-systems-and-agriculture#strategic-objectives) and [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/food-systems-and-agriculture#implementation-mechanisms).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The timeline spans five years, with annual milestones building toward the framework’s 2035 vision of reducing global hunger by 50%, achieving 30% regenerative farmland, and empowering 5 million farmers. Each year includes specific, measurable goals, from stakeholder engagement to policy reforms, supported by regular evaluations to refine strategies. This phased approach ensures steady progress while adapting to regional and global challenges.

*Accessible explanation*: A five-year plan with yearly goals to make food systems fairer and greener, with steps to check progress.

## <a id="year-1-2025"></a>Year 1 (2025)
**Focus**: Lay the foundation for framework adoption and initial implementation.

**Milestones**:
- Complete stakeholder mapping and establish a diverse steering committee with 50% representation from marginalized groups (Q1).
- Adopt the framework at the globalgovernanceframework.org summit, securing commitments from 50 countries (Q2).
- Launch 10 pilot projects in 5 regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia) to test regenerative practices and TEK integration (Q3).
- Develop initial regional dashboards and data platforms for real-time Key Performance Indicator (KPI) tracking (Q3).
- Train 50,000 farmers and 1,000 policymakers in regenerative agriculture and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) (Q4).
- Publish the first annual evaluation report to assess progress and refine strategies (Q4).

*Accessible explanation*: Start by setting up teams, launching small projects, and training people to get the plan going.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## <a id="year-2-2026"></a>Year 2 (2026)
**Focus**: Begin policy harmonization and scale pilot projects.

**Milestones**:
- Initiate policy harmonization workshops, engaging 30 countries to align with FAO Voluntary Guidelines and UNDRIP (Q1–Q4).
- Scale pilot projects from 10 to 50 across 10 regions, incorporating lessons from Year 1 evaluations (Q3).
- Establish 5 regional tech hubs to support open-source technology development (Q3).
- Train an additional 100,000 farmers in sustainable practices, with a focus on women and youth (Q4).
- Publish the second annual evaluation report, highlighting scalability and regional impacts (Q4).

*Accessible explanation*: Grow projects, start fixing rules in countries, and train more farmers to keep the plan moving.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

## <a id="year-3-2027"></a>Year 3 (2027)
**Focus**: Mobilize funding and conduct mid-term evaluation.

**Milestones**:
- Mobilize $10 billion of the $50 billion global fund through multilateral donors and public-private partnerships (Q1–Q2).
- Achieve 25% progress toward the 50% hunger reduction target, reaching 125 million people with improved food access (Q3).
- Train 500,000 farmers and 5,000 policymakers, with 50% of sessions incorporating TEK (Q4).
- Conduct a mid-term evaluation to assess progress, refine strategies, and identify scaling opportunities (Q4).
- Launch 100 cross-regional knowledge exchange workshops to share best practices (Q4).

*Accessible explanation*: Raise money, help more people get food, train more farmers, and check how the plan is doing.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

## <a id="year-4-2028"></a>Year 4 (2028)
**Focus**: Accelerate subsidy redirection and expand training.

**Milestones**:
- Redirect 20% of global agricultural subsidies to regenerative practices, engaging 50 countries (Q1–Q4).
- Train an additional 500,000 farmers, reaching a cumulative 1 million trained, with 100,000 youth and women-led initiatives supported (Q4).
- Scale 50 pilot projects to regional programs, covering 15% of global farmland under regenerative practices (Q4).
- Publish the third annual evaluation report, focusing on subsidy impacts and training outcomes (Q4).
- Establish 10 additional regional tech hubs to reduce tech dependency (Q4).

*Accessible explanation*: Shift money to eco-friendly farming, train a million farmers, and grow projects bigger.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 15 and SDG 5 (Gender Equality).

## <a id="year-5-2029"></a>Year 5 (2029)
**Focus**: Achieve full implementation and refine the framework.

**Milestones**:
- Achieve full implementation of the framework’s initial phase, with 50 countries fully aligned with policy and financing goals (Q1–Q4).
- Publish a global progress report, evaluating impacts on hunger, farmland, and equity, and outlining refinements for 2030–2035 (Q3).
- Train an additional 1 million farmers, reaching 2 million total, with 500 community-owned peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms operational (Q4).
- Expand fair trade certification to 25% of global agricultural exports (Q4).
- Conduct a comprehensive framework review to set the stage for the next phase toward 2035 goals (Q4).

*Accessible explanation*: Finish the first big phase, review progress, train more farmers, and plan for the future.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and UNDRIP.
