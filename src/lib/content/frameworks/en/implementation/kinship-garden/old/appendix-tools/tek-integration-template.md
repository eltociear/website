The *TEK Integration Template* is a customizable tool to guide stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—in respectfully incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into food system initiatives under the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. TEK, defined as indigenous and local environmental wisdom, is central to achieving sustainable and equitable food systems, as outlined in the framework’s [Integration of TEK](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms). This template ensures TEK is integrated ethically, aligning with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the framework’s [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) of equity and sustainability. It is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and supports pilot projects or broader implementation.

## Overview
The template provides a structured approach to:
- Identify relevant TEK sources and practices.
- Engage indigenous communities as co-governors and knowledge holders.
- Integrate TEK into agricultural or food system practices.
- Monitor and evaluate TEK’s impact to ensure cultural and ecological benefits.
- Commit to ethical principles respecting indigenous rights.

This tool fosters inclusive collaboration, ensuring indigenous voices lead the integration process, and supports the framework’s goal of training 500,000 farmers in TEK by 2030.

*Accessible explanation*: This template helps you work with indigenous communities to use their traditional knowledge, like special farming methods, to make food systems better while respecting their rights.

**Alignment**: Supports UNDRIP, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Template**: Replace placeholders (e.g., [Project Name], [Region]) with details specific to your initiative.
2. **Engage Indigenous Communities**: Convene initial meetings with indigenous leaders to co-design the integration process, ensuring their leadership.
3. **Complete Sections**: Fill in each section, tailoring strategies to your context and incorporating feedback from indigenous stakeholders.
4. **Document and Share**: Record TEK integration plans and share them with stakeholders via [e.g., community boards, globalgovernanceframework.org], respecting cultural sensitivities.
5. **Review Regularly**: Update the plan annually or as needed to reflect new insights or partnerships, ensuring ongoing relevance.

*Accessible explanation*: Fill in the blanks for your project, talk with indigenous leaders, write down the plan, share it carefully, and check it every year.

## TEK Integration Template
### Purpose and Context
**Purpose**: This TEK Integration Plan for [Project Name] aims to incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge into [specific goal, e.g., a regenerative farming pilot] in [Region] to enhance sustainability, equity, and resilience in alignment with the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*.

**Context**: [Describe the local context, e.g., drought-prone region with indigenous communities practicing crop rotation]. The plan respects indigenous rights per UNDRIP and seeks to [list outcomes, e.g., improve soil health, preserve local crop varieties].

*Accessible explanation*: Explain why and where you’re using indigenous knowledge, like improving farms in a dry area.

### Identifying TEK Sources
**Objective**: Identify relevant TEK practices and knowledge holders to inform the project.

**Steps**:
- **Map Knowledge Holders**: Collaborate with [e.g., local indigenous councils, elders] to identify TEK experts, targeting [number, e.g., 5–10] contributors.
- **Document Practices**: Record TEK practices (e.g., [specific practice, e.g., intercropping, seed saving]) through [method, e.g., interviews, workshops], ensuring cultural sensitivity.
- **Validate Sources**: Verify TEK with community leaders to ensure accuracy and respect, completing validation by [date, e.g., Q2 2025].

**Example**:
- In [Region], indigenous elders share knowledge of drought-resistant crop varieties, documented in a community-led workshop.

*Accessible explanation*: Find out who knows traditional farming methods, write them down respectfully, and check with community leaders.

### Engaging Indigenous Communities
**Objective**: Establish respectful, co-governance partnerships with indigenous communities, as outlined in [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement).

**Strategies**:
- **Initial Engagement**: Hold [number, e.g., 2–3] co-design workshops with [e.g., indigenous councils, women’s groups] by [date, e.g., Q1 2025] to shape TEK integration.
- **Co-Governance Roles**: Assign [e.g., 50%] representation to indigenous leaders in [e.g., steering committee], ensuring decision-making authority.
- **Compensation**: Provide fair compensation (e.g., [amount, e.g., $500 per workshop], knowledge-sharing grants) for TEK contributions, respecting community protocols.
- **Cultural Protocols**: Follow [e.g., community-specific guidelines, UNDRIP principles] for sharing and using TEK, avoiding appropriation.

**Example**:
- A workshop in [Region] engages 20 indigenous farmers to co-design a seed-saving program, with elders leading decisions.

*Accessible explanation*: Meet with indigenous groups, let them lead, pay them fairly, and follow their rules for using their knowledge.

### Integrating TEK into Practices
**Objective**: Apply TEK to specific food system practices, aligning with [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives).

**Integration Plan**:
- **Selected Practices**: Incorporate [list practices, e.g., agroforestry, traditional irrigation] into [e.g., farming pilot, food hub], targeting [number, e.g., 1–3] practices by [date, e.g., Q3 2025].
- **Training**: Train [number, e.g., 50] farmers in TEK-based methods using [e.g., community-led workshops, videos], in collaboration with indigenous trainers.
- **Resources**: Provide [e.g., seeds, tools] to support TEK implementation, sourced via [e.g., local cooperatives, framework funding].
- **Pilot Testing**: Test TEK practices in [e.g., 1–2 pilot sites], documenting outcomes for scalability.

**Example**:
- In [Region], TEK-based intercropping is piloted on 10 hectares, training 30 farmers with indigenous-led sessions.

*Accessible explanation*: Use traditional methods, like planting crops together, in your project, train people, and test them in small areas.

### Monitoring and Evaluation
**Objective**: Track TEK integration outcomes to ensure cultural, ecological, and social benefits, as per [Monitoring and Evaluation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

**Metrics**:
- **Quantitative**: [e.g., Number of farmers trained in TEK (target: 50 by 2025), hectares using TEK practices (target: 10 by 2025)].
- **Qualitative**: [e.g., Community satisfaction with TEK integration (target: 80% approval via surveys), cultural preservation (e.g., documented practices)].
- **Process**: Conduct [e.g., quarterly] reviews with indigenous leaders to assess impact, using [e.g., surveys, focus groups].
- **Reporting**: Share outcomes via [e.g., community meetings, globalgovernanceframework.org], respecting data sovereignty.

**Example**:
- A pilot in [Region] reports 90% community approval for TEK-based irrigation, documented in a public dashboard.

*Accessible explanation*: Check how well the traditional knowledge is working by counting trained people and asking communities if they’re happy.

### Commitment to Ethical Integration
**Objective**: Formalize commitment to respectful and equitable TEK integration.

We, the undersigned, commit to integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge into [Project Name] in a manner that respects indigenous rights, aligns with UNDRIP, and supports the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. We pledge to prioritize co-governance, cultural sensitivity, and equitable benefits.
