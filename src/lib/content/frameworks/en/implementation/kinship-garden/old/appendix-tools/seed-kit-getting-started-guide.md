The *Getting Started Guide for the Seed Kit* is a simple, practical introduction to using the *Seed Kit*—a collection of tools from the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* designed to help stakeholders launch projects or advocate for better food systems. Aimed at farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors, this guide provides clear steps to begin, whether you’re starting a community garden, adopting regenerative farming, or pushing for policy changes. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), it supports the framework’s [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms) and makes the framework accessible to everyone, no matter their experience level.

## What Is the Seed Kit?
The *Seed Kit* is a set of free, downloadable tools to help you improve how food is grown, shared, and eaten in your community. It includes guides, templates, and playbooks to:
- Plan and start projects, like regenerative farming or local food hubs.
- Work fairly with others, including indigenous communities and youth.
- Check progress and make sure your project is helping people and the planet.
- Convince leaders to support fair and green food systems.

You can download the kit at [the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) or access individual tools at the [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/food-systems).

*Accessible explanation*: The kit is a toolbox with guides to start projects like farms, work together, track results, and talk to leaders about better food systems.

**Alignment**: Supports [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/food-systems).

## Why Use the Kit?
The kit helps you:
- **Make a Difference**: Turn ideas into real projects that feed people, protect the environment, and include everyone.
- **Save Time**: Use ready-made tools to plan, collaborate, and advocate without starting from scratch.
- **Build Trust**: Work respectfully with communities, especially indigenous groups, to create fair solutions.
- **Reach Big Goals**: Contribute to the framework’s aims, like cutting hunger by 50% and making 30% of farmland regenerative by 2035.

*Accessible explanation*: The kit makes it easier to start projects that help people eat better, keep the planet healthy, and work fairly with others.

**Alignment**: Supports [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) and [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives).

## Step-by-Step Guide to Get Started
**Purpose**: Provide clear steps to begin using the *Seed Kit*.

1. **Learn the Basics**:
   - Read the [Food Systems Framework Lite Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/food-systems-framework-lite-guide-en.md) to understand the framework’s big ideas, like sustainable farming and fair food systems.
   - Time: [e.g., 15–30 minutes].

2. **Pick a Goal**:
   - Decide what you want to do, like start a community garden, train farmers in regenerative farming or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), or ask for better local rules.
   - Example: “I want to start a small farm using regenerative methods in [Your Area].”

3. **Check Your Readiness**:
   - Use the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.md) to see if you’re ready to start your project. Answer questions about your team, resources, and plans.
   - Time: [e.g., 1 hour].

4. **Build a Team**:
   - Bring together people like farmers, indigenous leaders, or youth using the [Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.md) to agree on how you’ll work together.
   - Example: Meet with 5–10 community members to plan a project.

5. **Plan Your Project**:
   - Use tools like the [Regenerative Farming Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.md) to adopt eco-friendly practices, the [TEK Integration Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.md) to include indigenous knowledge, or the [Cost-Benefit Analysis Model](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/cost-benefit-analysis-model-en.md) to check if your project is worth the cost.
   - Time: [e.g., 1–2 weeks].

6. **Track Progress**:
   - Set goals and check how you’re doing with the [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.md).
   - Example: Count how many people get food from your garden or how much soil improves.

7. **Share and Advocate**:
   - Tell others about your work using the [Advocacy Playbook](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/advocacy-playbook-en.md) or push for better rules with the [Policy Harmonization Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/policy-harmonization-toolkit-en.md).
   - Example: Post a video about your regenerative farm on social media with #FoodSystemsFuture.

*Accessible explanation*: Learn the plan, choose a goal like starting a garden, check if you’re ready, team up, plan details, track results, and tell others about it.

**Alignment**: Supports [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

- **Include Everyone**: Work with diverse people, especially indigenous groups, women, and youth, to make your project stronger.
- **Use Local Knowledge**: Ask community elders or farmers about local ways to grow food, using the [TEK Integration Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.md) or [Regenerative Farming Guide](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.md).
- **Keep It Simple**: Use plain language and low-tech solutions, like paper forms or radio, to reach more people.
- **Share Your Story**: Post about your project on [e.g., social media, community boards] or email [globalgovernanceframeworks@gmail.com] to inspire others.
