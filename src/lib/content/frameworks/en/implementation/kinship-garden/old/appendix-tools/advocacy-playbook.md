The *Advocacy Playbook* is a practical guide to empower stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and private sectors—to advocate for the adoption and implementation of the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. By promoting its vision of resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems, this playbook supports the framework’s [Communication and Advocacy](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#13-communication-advocacy) goals, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines. Designed for accessibility, it provides strategies, messaging, and examples to mobilize support and influence policy, ensuring the framework’s transformative impact by 2035. This tool is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip).
