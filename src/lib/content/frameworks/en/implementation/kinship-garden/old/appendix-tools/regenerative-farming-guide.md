The *Regenerative Farming Guide* is a practical tool to help stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local governments—adopt regenerative farming practices under the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. Designed to promote sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems, this guide provides simple steps to implement techniques that improve soil health, boost biodiversity, and fight climate change. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), it supports the framework’s goal of achieving 30% regenerative farmland by 2035. This guide is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and complements the framework’s [Implementation Mechanisms](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

## Overview
Regenerative farming is a way of growing food that restores the environment, supports communities, and strengthens farms against challenges like drought or floods. This guide explains key practices, offers steps to start, and shares examples from different regions. It’s designed for beginners and experienced farmers alike, with a focus on including Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and local wisdom.

*Accessible explanation*: This guide shows you how to farm in a way that helps the soil, plants, animals, and people, making your farm stronger and the planet healthier.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

## What Is Regenerative Farming?
Regenerative farming grows food while improving the land, unlike traditional methods that may harm soil or rely heavily on chemicals. It focuses on:
- **Soil Health**: Building rich, fertile soil to grow better crops and store carbon.
- **Biodiversity**: Supporting plants, animals, and insects for a balanced ecosystem.
- **Water Management**: Saving water and preventing runoff to protect rivers and lakes.
- **Community Benefits**: Creating jobs, sharing knowledge, and respecting indigenous practices.

**Benefits**:
- Higher crop yields over time (e.g., 10–20% increase after 3 years).
- Lower costs by reducing fertilizers and pesticides (e.g., 30% savings).
- Climate action by storing carbon (e.g., 1–2 tonnes per hectare annually).
- Stronger farms that survive droughts or floods better.

*Accessible explanation*: Regenerative farming makes soil and nature healthier, saves money, fights climate change, and helps farms last longer.

**Alignment**: Supports [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles).

## Key Practices
**Purpose**: Introduce simple regenerative farming techniques anyone can try.

1. **Cover Cropping**:
   - Plant crops like clover or beans between main crops to protect soil, add nutrients, and prevent erosion.
   - Example: Sow clover after harvesting maize to keep soil healthy.

2. **Crop Rotation**:
   - Change crops each season (e.g., maize, then beans, then sorghum) to improve soil and reduce pests.
   - Example: Rotate crops yearly to avoid soil exhaustion.

3. **No-Till or Low-Till Farming**:
   - Avoid plowing to keep soil structure intact, retain moisture, and store carbon.
   - Example: Use hand tools to plant seeds directly into undisturbed soil.

4. **Agroforestry**:
   - Grow trees with crops or livestock to provide shade, enrich soil, and protect against wind.
   - Example: Plant fruit trees among vegetable fields for shade and extra income.

5. **Composting**:
   - Turn food scraps, crop waste, or manure into natural fertilizer to feed soil.
   - Example: Build a compost pile with kitchen waste to use on your farm.

6. **Integrating TEK**:
   - Use indigenous practices, like traditional seed saving or intercropping, to enhance resilience.
   - Example: Learn from local elders to plant crops that thrive in your climate.

*Accessible explanation*: Try planting extra crops, switching crops each year, avoiding digging, adding trees, making compost, or using local traditional methods to make your farm better.

**Alignment**: Supports [Integration of TEK](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

## Steps to Get Started
**Purpose**: Provide a clear path to begin regenerative farming.

1. **Assess Your Farm**:
   - Look at your land, water, and crops to see what regenerative practices fit best.
   - Use the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.md) to check readiness.
   - Time: [e.g., 1–2 hours].

2. **Learn Local Practices**:
   - Talk to indigenous farmers or elders about TEK, like drought-resistant crops.
   - Use the [TEK Integration Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.md) to plan respectfully.
   - Time: [e.g., 1–2 weeks].

3. **Choose One or Two Practices**:
   - Start small with practices like cover cropping or composting.
   - Example: Try cover cropping on [e.g., 1 hectare] for one season.

4. **Build a Team**:
   - Work with neighbors, youth, or local groups using the [Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.md).
   - Example: Form a group of 5 farmers to share tools and knowledge.

5. **Find Resources**:
   - Check costs and benefits with the [Cost-Benefit Analysis Model](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/cost-benefit-analysis-model-en.md) to secure funding (e.g., local grants, NGOs).
   - Example: Apply for a $1,000 grant for seeds and compost materials.

6. **Track Progress**:
   - Measure results, like better soil or more crops, with the [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.md).
   - Example: Count how much your yields increase after one season.

7. **Share Your Success**:
   - Tell others about your farm using the [Advocacy Playbook](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/advocacy-playbook-en.md) to inspire more farmers.
   - Example: Post a photo of your healthy crops on social media with #FoodSystemsFuture.

*Accessible explanation*: Check your farm, learn local ways, try one or two new methods, team up, find money, measure results, and share your story.

**Alignment**: Supports [Regional Customization](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#10-regional-customization).

## Regional Examples
**Purpose**: Show how regenerative farming works in different places.

- **South Asia (India)**:
  - Practice: Agroforestry with mango trees and vegetables to protect against monsoons.

- **Island Nations (Maldives)**:
  - Practice: Composting with fish waste to enrich sandy soils.
  - Impact: Grew vegetables for 20 households on small plots.
  - Tool: Used [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.md) to track food output.
