The *Cost-Benefit Analysis Model* is a customizable tool to assist stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—in evaluating the financial, social, and environmental impacts of initiatives under the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*. By comparing costs against benefits, this model supports decision-making for pilot projects or broader efforts, such as regenerative farming or local food hubs, ensuring alignment with the framework’s [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives) and [Core Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles) of sustainability, equity, and resilience. Designed for accessibility, it is part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and supports the framework’s [Financing](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms) goals, aiding stakeholders in securing funding and justifying investments.

## Overview
The model provides a structured approach to:
- Define the scope and objectives of a project.
- Identify and quantify costs (e.g., financial, labor) and benefits (e.g., increased yields, carbon sequestration).
- Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to assess viability.
- Interpret results to guide implementation and attract funding.

This tool supports the framework’s aim to mobilize $50 billion by 2027 for sustainable food systems, ensuring projects deliver measurable value aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

*Accessible explanation*: This tool helps you figure out if a project, like a new farm, is worth doing by comparing what it costs with the good things it brings, like more food or a healthier environment.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Model**: Replace placeholders (e.g., [Project Name], [Region]) with details specific to your initiative.
2. **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve [e.g., farmers, indigenous leaders, financial experts] to ensure accurate cost and benefit estimates, prioritizing marginalized groups.
3. **Complete Sections**: Fill in each section, using local data and framework-aligned metrics where possible.
4. **Perform Analysis**: Calculate costs and benefits, using the provided formulas and example calculations.
5. **Share Results**: Present findings to stakeholders and funders via [e.g., reports, community meetings, globalgovernanceframework.org], and use them to refine project plans or secure funding.

*Accessible explanation*: Fill in details about your project, work with your team to list costs and benefits, do the math, and share results to decide what to do next.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Model
### Project Scope and Objectives
**Purpose**: Define the initiative’s goals and context to frame the analysis.

**Scope**:
- **Project Name**: [e.g., Regenerative Farming Pilot]
- **Region**: [e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, [Country]]
- **Timeframe**: [e.g., 2025–2027]
- **Description**: [e.g., Train 100 farmers in regenerative practices to increase yields and sequester carbon on 50 hectares].

**Objectives**:
- [e.g., Increase crop yields by 20% by 2027].
- [e.g., Sequester 500 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) annually by 2027].
- [e.g., Improve food access for 200 households by 2027].

**Alignment with Framework**:
- [e.g., Supports promoting sustainable practices (SDG 15) and enhancing food security (SDG 2)].

*Accessible explanation*: Describe your project, where and when it’s happening, and what you want to achieve, like growing more food or helping the environment.

### Identifying Costs
**Purpose**: List and quantify all costs associated with the project.

**Cost Categories**:
- **Financial Costs**:
  - [e.g., Seeds and tools: $5,000].
  - [e.g., Training workshops: $3,000 for facilitators and materials].
  - [e.g., Infrastructure (e.g., irrigation): $10,000].
- **Labor Costs**:
  - [e.g., 500 hours of farmer labor at $10/hour: $5,000].
  - [e.g., 100 hours of coordinator time at $20/hour: $2,000].
- **Opportunity Costs**:
  - [e.g., Time diverted from traditional farming: $2,000 in lost income].
- **Other Costs**:
  - [e.g., Monitoring and evaluation: $1,000 for data collection].

**Total Estimated Costs**: [e.g., $28,000 over 2 years].

**Data Sources**:
- [e.g., Local market prices, stakeholder consultations, NGO budgets].

*Accessible explanation*: Write down everything the project will cost, like buying seeds, paying people, or time spent not doing other work.

### Identifying Benefits
**Purpose**: List and quantify all benefits, including financial, social, and environmental impacts.

**Benefit Categories**:
- **Financial Benefits**:
  - [e.g., Increased crop yields (20% more, valued at $6,000 annually)].
  - [e.g., Reduced input costs (e.g., fertilizers) by $2,000 annually].
- **Social Benefits**:
  - [e.g., Improved food access for 200 households, valued at $4,000 based on local food prices].
  - [e.g., Community empowerment through TEK training, qualitatively assessed via surveys].
- **Environmental Benefits**:
  - [e.g., Carbon sequestration (500 tCO2e annually, valued at $50/tonne = $25,000)].
  - [e.g., Enhanced biodiversity, qualitatively assessed via species counts].

**Total Estimated Benefits**: [e.g., $37,000 annually, plus qualitative benefits].

**Data Sources**:
- [e.g., Agricultural yield data, carbon market prices, community feedback].

*Accessible explanation*: List what the project will gain, like more money from crops, better food for people, or helping the planet by storing carbon.

### Conducting the Analysis
**Purpose**: Compare costs and benefits to assess project viability.

**Steps**:
1. **Quantify Costs and Benefits**:
   - Total Costs: [e.g., $28,000 over 2 years].
   - Total Benefits: [e.g., $37,000/year × 2 years = $74,000].
2. **Calculate Net Present Value (NPV)**:
   - Formula: NPV = Σ (Benefits - Costs) / (1 + r)^t, where r = discount rate (e.g., 5%), t = year.
   - Example: NPV = ($37,000 - $14,000)/(1.05)^1 + ($37,000 - $14,000)/(1.05)^2 = $21,905 + $20,862 = $42,767.
3. **Calculate Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**:
   - Formula: BCR = Total Benefits / Total Costs.
   - Example: BCR = $74,000 / $28,000 = 2.64 (a value > 1 indicates benefits outweigh costs).
4. **Qualitative Assessment**:
   - [e.g., Community empowerment and biodiversity gains add unquantified value, supporting long-term sustainability].

**Example Calculation**:
- A regenerative farming pilot in [Region] has costs of $28,000 and benefits of $74,000 over 2 years. NPV = $42,767, BCR = 2.64, indicating strong viability.

*Accessible explanation*: Add up costs and benefits, use simple math to see if the project is worth it, and note extra benefits like happier communities.

### Interpreting Results and Next Steps
**Purpose**: Use analysis outcomes to guide decisions and secure support.

**Interpretation**:
- **Positive NPV and BCR > 1**: [e.g., NPV = $42,767, BCR = 2.64] indicates the project is financially viable and delivers significant benefits.
- **Negative NPV or BCR < 1**: Reassess costs (e.g., reduce infrastructure expenses) or enhance benefits (e.g., scale training).
- **Qualitative Benefits**: Highlight non-financial impacts (e.g., TEK preservation) to attract funders valuing social or environmental outcomes.

**Next Steps**:
- **Proceed**: If viable, use results to finalize project plans and launch, referencing the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/food-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.md).
- **Seek Funding**: Present analysis to [e.g., local governments, NGOs, carbon markets] to secure [e.g., $28,000], as outlined in [Financing](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).
- **Refine**: If not viable, adjust scope (e.g., smaller pilot) or explore partnerships to reduce costs.
- **Share**: Report findings via [e.g., community meetings, globalgovernanceframework.org] to build trust and support.

**Example**:
- A pilot in [Region] with a BCR of 2.64 secures $15,000 from an NGO, launches training for 100 farmers, and shares results at a community forum.

*Accessible explanation*: Look at the numbers to decide if the project is good. If it is, start it and find money. If not, make it cheaper or try something else.
