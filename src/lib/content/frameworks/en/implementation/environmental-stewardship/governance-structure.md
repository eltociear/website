The Ecological Intelligence & Rights Layer operates through a multi-level governance structure designed to integrate ecological science, traditional knowledge, and ethical technology oversight across local to global scales. As the scientific brain and ecological conscience of the Global Governance Framework (GGF) ecosystem, this governance structure generates critical data and standards while ensuring community sovereignty and Indigenous co-governance principles guide all decision-making processes.

Unlike traditional top-down environmental governance, this structure positions communities and bioregions as primary implementers while providing strategic coordination and scientific standards through the Planetary Health Council. This approach ensures that ecological intelligence flows from community monitoring and traditional knowledge up to global coordination, while strategic guidance and resources flow back down to support local implementation.

This governance structure reflects the framework's evolution as the Ecological Intelligence & Rights Layer within the Global Governance Framework ecosystem. By positioning the Planetary Health Council as strategic coordinator and BAZs as implementation engines, it creates a system where ecological intelligence flows from community-based monitoring and traditional knowledge up to global coordination, while resources and strategic guidance flow back down to support local restoration and rights protection efforts. The emphasis on Indigenous co-governance, community sovereignty, and cross-framework integration ensures this governance system serves rather than supplants community leadership while providing the coordination necessary for planetary-scale environmental challenges.
