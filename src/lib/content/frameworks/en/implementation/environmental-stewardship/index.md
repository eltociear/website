The **Ecological Intelligence & Rights Layer** serves as the scientific brain and ecological conscience of the Global Governance Framework (GGF) ecosystem. Operating within a broader network of interconnected frameworks, it provides essential ecological standards, rights architecture, and ethical technology protocols that guide community-led restoration, enforce planetary boundaries, and ensure technologies align with the well-being of all beings—human, non-human, and ecological.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Ecological Intelligence & Rights Layer is positioned as **Tier 2** within the Global Governance Framework ecosystem, serving as the primary data and standards-setting engine for planetary health governance. Unlike standalone environmental frameworks, it operates as an integrated component that feeds critical ecological intelligence to other framework layers while receiving implementation capacity from community-based governance structures.

**Purpose**: Generate *Ecosystem Health Indicators* and *Biosphere Health Index (BHI)* for strategic oversight, provide rights architecture through the *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*, and commission ethical technology protocols to guide restoration, enforcement, and regenerative economic systems across the GGF ecosystem.

**Framework Position**: Functions as the ecological conscience for:
- **Planetary Health Council (PHC)**: Providing data for strategic planetary boundary decisions
- **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**: Supporting community-led environmental restoration  
- **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**: Feeding ecological health data into reward systems
- **Justice Systems**: Transferring ecosystem rights for legal enforcement
- **Technology Governance**: Commissioning ethical protocols for emerging technologies

**Vision for 2050**: A regenerative world where:
- 100 ecosystems have legal personhood globally with effective guardianship
- 80% of communities have equitable access to environmental commons
- BAZs lead ecosystem restoration with Indigenous co-governance (50% representation)
- Technologies align with *Right Relationship* principles through ethical assessment
- Planetary boundaries are maintained through integrated monitoring and enforcement

**Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Build momentum through:
- 30% ecosystem restoration achieved in BAZ pilot regions
- 50% adoption of AUBI rewards for ecological stewardship work
- 25 ecosystems granted legal personhood with functional guardianship
- Indigenous-led initiatives established in 10 bioregional pilots

**Alignment with Global Agreements**:
- Paris Agreement climate targets and enhanced NDCs
- Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (30x30 protection goals)
- Sustainable Development Goals (particularly SDGs 13, 14, 15)
- UNFCCC and CBD processes with spiritual and Indigenous integration

**Key Innovations**:
- *Dynamic Rights Spectrum* recognizing rights for ecosystems, species, and potentially conscious AI
- *Data-to-Reward Pipeline* linking verified ecological health to economic incentives
- Indigenous co-governance with guaranteed 50% representation in regional leadership
- Integration of spiritual wisdom and traditional ecological knowledge in governance
- Ethical technology assessment preventing harmful deployment in ecological contexts
