### Case Study: Community-Led Wellbeing Assessment

**Case Study: Māori-Led Wellbeing Evaluation Using Traditional and Contemporary Indicators**

In Aotearoa New Zealand's emerging BAZ, **Community Wellbeing Index** assessment integrates traditional Māori health concepts like hauora (holistic wellbeing) with contemporary indicators through Community Provider services. **Community Provider health and cultural services** contribute to whakapapa (genealogical connections), whenua (land relationships), and whakatōhea (tribal identity) while earning **Hearts investment** measured through both quantitative data and traditional storytelling evaluation methods.

Community members invest Hearts in Community Provider services that support traditional wellness concepts—cultural education earning Hearts for identity strengthening, ecological restoration services earning Hearts for land relationship healing, intergenerational care services earning Hearts for whakapapa connection.

**GGF Mechanisms in Action:**
* Community Wellbeing Index integrating Indigenous evaluation methods with Community Provider service assessment
* Hearts investment supporting traditional wellbeing concepts through community-controlled service delivery
* Community-controlled assessment respecting cultural protocols in service evaluation
* Storytelling and data integration providing holistic evaluation of Community Provider effectiveness

**Real-World Analogue:** This scenario builds on **Māori health frameworks** like **Te Whare Tapa Whā** and wellbeing evaluation approaches used by organizations like **Te Puni Kōkiri**, demonstrating how Indigenous evaluation methodologies can provide more comprehensive and culturally appropriate assessment than Western metrics alone when applied to Community Provider service delivery.
