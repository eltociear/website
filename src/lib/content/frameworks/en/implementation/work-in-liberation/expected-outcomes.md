What does victory look like when Community Provider services serve life instead of exploitation? How do we measure the unmeasurable—the moment when a teenager discovers their gifts matter through Hearts investment in youth education services, when an elder's wisdom finds community support through cultural preservation Community Providers, when damaged land begins to breathe again under the care of restoration teams supported by community investment?

The outcomes we expect from Work in Liberation aren't just numbers on a dashboard, though we track those too. They're the stories communities tell about their own transformation, the changes visible in children's eyes when they see adults doing Community Provider services they love, the way people move differently through their days when survival anxiety no longer drives every choice and Hearts investment creates sustainable alternatives.

But revolutionary dreams without concrete targets remain fantasies. So we measure both the quantifiable and the qualitative, the statistical and the spiritual, tracking our progress toward a world where **Community Provider services become the expression of our deepest care for life itself**.

## <a id="transformation-measuring"></a>The Transformation We're Measuring

Every measurement in this framework serves a simple question: *Are we creating conditions where human beings can offer their best gifts through Community Provider services while communities can sustainably invest in the work they value most?* The numbers matter because they represent real people finding meaningful Community Provider services, real ecosystems recovering health through restoration teams, real communities discovering their collective power through Hearts investment.

Consider Amara, a former Uber driver in Lagos who joins a Community Provider organizing neighborhood food systems in **Year 3 of her BAZ's pilot program**. **Seven years later**, her food sovereignty services earn more through Hearts investment than she ever made driving strangers around the city. Her Community Provider team teaches nutrition education while supporting traditional Nigerian food systems through community investment. When we count "25% reduction in gig platform dependency," we're counting Amara's liberation—and thousands of stories like hers enabled by Hearts investment in meaningful services.

Or think about the Menominee Nation in Wisconsin, whose traditional forestry knowledge guides a Community Provider that's sequestered 2 million tons of carbon while providing sustainable timber and Hearts income for tribal members through community investment in ecological restoration services. When we measure "40% increase in carbon sequestration," we're measuring the healing of relationships between Indigenous communities and their territories supported by Hearts Treasury infrastructure.

**These outcomes aren't predictions—they're commitments.** Every target represents communities we refuse to abandon, ecosystems we promise to heal through Community Provider services, young people whose futures we're determined to transform through community investment systems.

## <a id="quantified-planetary-healing"></a>Quantified Planetary Healing

The Earth doesn't lie. Soil either holds carbon or it doesn't. Species populations either recover or they decline. Watersheds either run clean or they carry poison. While human systems can be gamed or manipulated, ecological indicators provide unforgiving honesty about whether Community Provider services truly serve life and whether Hearts investment creates genuine ecological benefit.

### **Ecological Restoration Targets Within 20 Years**

**40% of Global Land Within Community Provider Ecosystem Under Regenerative Stewardship**: This means Community Provider teams managing nearly 6 billion hectares through traditional knowledge-guided restoration, regenerative agriculture, and rewilding projects supported by Hearts investment. Indigenous communities lead this work, earning community investment through Hearts while healing territories colonization damaged.

*Imagine flying across continents after two decades of implementation and seeing a different world below: vast grasslands where cattle once overgrazed restored by Community Provider pastoral teams, forests returning to former clearcuts through restoration services earning Hearts investment, wetlands filtering watersheds clean again through Community Provider ecological services. This isn't romantic imagination—it's what happens when millions of people earn sustainable livelihoods through Community Provider ecological restoration rather than extraction.*

**60% Increase in Biodiversity in Community Provider Managed Areas**: Species recovery becomes the measure of successful Community Provider services. Teams track wildlife populations, pollinator networks, and ecosystem health as core service performance indicators while earning Hearts investment for measurable biodiversity improvement.

**2 Billion Tons Annual Carbon Sequestration Through Community Provider Services**: Forest restoration, regenerative agriculture, wetland creation, and soil building projects organized as Community Provider services earning Hearts investment. This represents removing atmospheric carbon equivalent to shutting down 500 coal plants—but through Community Provider services that create abundance rather than scarcity.

**80% Reduction in Agricultural Chemical Use Through Community Provider Transition**: As Community Provider agricultural services transition farming systems to ecological methods combining traditional knowledge with contemporary organic practices, earning Hearts investment for soil health improvement and food system transformation.

### **Climate Resilience Achievement Through Community Investment**

**75% Reduction in Climate-Related Economic Losses**: Compared to business-as-usual scenarios, communities with strong Community Provider systems suffer dramatically less economic disruption during climate events because their economies prioritize resilience through Hearts investment rather than efficiency through profit extraction.

**1000 Climate-Resilient Communities Within 20 Years**: Urban and rural areas where Community Provider teams have transformed infrastructure for climate adaptation—urban forests, food systems, renewable energy, flood management—all organized through democratic service coordination earning Hearts investment for community protection.

### **Regenerative Technology Integration Through Community Provider Services**

**90% Renewable Energy in BAZ Territories Through Community Provider Systems**: Community-owned renewable systems installed and maintained by Community Provider energy teams earning Hearts investment, ensuring energy democracy accompanies energy transition through community control rather than corporate ownership.

**Zero Waste Achievement in 500 Communities Through Community Provider Coordination**: Repair, reuse, composting, and circular economy systems organized as Community Provider services earning Hearts investment while eliminating the waste that capitalism treats as inevitable through democratic resource management.

## <a id="community-flourishing"></a>Community Flourishing Indicators

Numbers can capture scale, but they struggle with depth. How do you quantify the moment when a community discovers it can sustainably support the services it values most through Hearts investment? How do you measure the relief in a parent's voice when they realize their child will grow up with meaningful Community Provider services available? How do you count the restoration of dignity through community investment systems?

### **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) Transformation**

**50% Increase in Global LMCI Scores Within 20 Years**: This represents the single most important outcome—measurable improvement in human flourishing across love (relationships and care), meaning (purpose and growth), and connection (human-land harmony) supported by Community Provider services and Hearts investment systems.

*Picture the grandmother in rural Bangladesh whose traditional weaving knowledge suddenly becomes valuable again through Hearts investment in cultural education Community Provider services, connecting her with young people eager to learn while providing sustainable income that honors her expertise. Her LMCI score captures not just her individual wellbeing but the community's renewed appreciation for elder wisdom through Community Provider cultural services.*

**85% Reduction in Work-Related Mental Health Issues**: As survival anxiety decreases through AUBI Layer 1 and work becomes voluntary contribution to Community Provider services rather than coerced labor. Community mental health workers—themselves earning Hearts through care service Community Providers—track depression, anxiety, and burnout rates.

**70% Increase in Intergenerational Connection**: Measured through elder-youth partnership participation in Community Provider services, traditional knowledge transmission rates through educational Community Providers, and community storytelling activities supported by Hearts investment in cultural preservation.

### **Community Self-Reliance Growth Through Community Provider Networks**

**80% Local Service Security Achievement**: Communities meet 80% of their service needs through local Community Provider networks organizing childcare, eldercare, education, healthcare, and cultural programming supported by Hearts investment rather than depending on corporate service providers.

### **Social Cohesion and Trust Building Through Community Investment**

**60% Increase in Community Participation**: More people engaged in local decision-making, cultural activities, and Hearts investment as economic security through AUBI enables community involvement rather than survival focus while Community Provider services strengthen social bonds.

**75% Reduction in Community Conflict**: As economic stress decreases through AUBI and restorative justice practices (via Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework) become embedded in Community Provider services rather than punitive approaches to community problems. Conflict becomes opportunity for deeper understanding rather than division.

**40% Increase in Cross-Cultural Cooperation**: Measured through inter-community Community Provider collaboration, cultural exchange programs supported by Hearts investment, and successful conflict resolution between different cultural groups within bioregions through Community Provider mediation services.

## <a id="economic-justice"></a>Economic Justice Achievements

The most powerful outcome of Work in Liberation isn't just that everyone has work—it's that everyone can access Community Provider services that honor their humanity while communities can sustainably invest in the work they value most. Economic justice means both material security through AUBI and meaningful service access through Hearts investment, both individual dignity and collective flourishing through Community Provider systems.

### **Inequality Transformation Within 20 Years**

**60% Reduction in Global Gini Coefficient**: Representing the most dramatic decrease in inequality in human history, achieved through AUBI foundation plus Hearts investment systems that enable communities to support essential services currently unpaid or undervalued through Community Provider organization.

Within two decades of implementation, this ratio drops to 15:1 as Community Provider services for care work, ecological restoration, and community organizing earn significant Hearts income while excessive accumulation becomes culturally unacceptable and economically unnecessary through democratic investment systems.*

**90% Elimination of Absolute Poverty**: Through AUBI Layer 1 providing unconditional basic income plus Community Provider service access through Hearts investment opportunities. Poverty becomes a policy choice we refuse to make rather than an inevitable condition while community investment ensures service availability.

## <a id="democratic-participation"></a>Democratic Participation Expansion

Work in Liberation doesn't just change what people do for income—it transforms how communities make decisions about their collective future through Community Provider democratic governance and Hearts investment priorities. When Community Provider services become democratic through community investment, democracy extends beyond elections into daily life.

### **Community Self-Governance Growth Through Community Provider Networks**

## **Looking Forward: The World We're Building**

Within a generation, a child born anywhere on Earth will grow up expecting Community Provider services to be available and communities to invest Hearts in the work they value most. They'll learn traditional knowledge alongside contemporary skills through Community Provider educational services, participate in Hearts investment decisions from an early age, and understand ecological restoration as normal Community Provider activity.

This child will make their first Hearts investment at age 16 in Community Provider youth services, participate in their first Community Provider educational programs for traditional plant medicine habitat restoration, their first taste of democracy through Community Provider service coordination. They'll never know survival anxiety because AUBI will ensure basic security from birth while Hearts allocation will enable community investment capacity. They'll never accept meaningless work because they'll see adults around them providing Community Provider services they love while communities flourish through Hearts investment in mutual aid.

The numbers in this section—the percentages and targets and metrics—they're all just ways of counting the children who will grow up with access to Community Provider services, the communities that will discover their power to invest in meaningful work, the ecosystems that will remember how to breathe through restoration services.

*This is what we're measuring: the healing of the world through Community Provider services, one relationship at a time, one Hearts investment at a time, one restored ecosystem at a time.*

*The outcomes we expect aren't just statistics—they're promises we make to each other, to the children not yet born, to the more-than-human world that sustains all life. Every target is a commitment to Community Provider development, every metric a covenant for Hearts investment systems, every measurement a love letter to the future we refuse to abandon through community-supported transformation.*

**Next Steps**: These expected outcomes provide the destination markers for our Community Provider and Hearts investment journey. Continue to [Framework Integration](/frameworks/work-in-liberation#framework-integration) to explore how this transformation coordinates with other Global Governance Framework components, or access the [Outcomes Tracking Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/work-in-liberation/outcomes-tracking-toolkit.pdf) to begin measuring transformation through Community Provider development in your community.

**Implementation Note**: Start measuring what you value now, even before full Community Provider implementation. Track community wellbeing, ecological health, and democratic participation in whatever form exists currently. These baseline measurements will reveal the transformation as Community Provider services unfold, while the practice of collective measurement builds the culture of accountability and learning that Hearts investment systems require.
