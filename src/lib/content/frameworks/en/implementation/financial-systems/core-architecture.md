*In Medellín, Colombia, former conflict zones have transformed into thriving neighborhoods through integrated systems that work like healthy ecosystems. Community libraries connect with urban gardens that link to cooperative businesses that support elder care networks. Each component strengthens the others—education improves nutrition, which supports economic development, which funds community care, which creates social cohesion that enables learning. The city's integrated transformation demonstrates how infrastructure works best when designed as living systems rather than isolated components.*

*The Hearts and Leaves core architecture applies this living systems wisdom to financial infrastructure. Rather than separate platforms competing for market share, the components function as an integrated ecosystem where circulation creates health, diversity builds resilience, and cooperation generates abundance. Like Medellín's transformation, success emerges from relationships between components rather than just individual efficiency.*

## <a id="living-system-design"></a>Living System Design: Right Relationship as Infrastructure

Hearts and Leaves systems operate through **Right Relationship** principles where economic infrastructure serves the sacred interconnection between human flourishing, ecological health, and community wellbeing through designed flows that strengthen rather than extract from these relationships.
