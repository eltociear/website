# Financial Systems Framework: At-a-Glance

*Hearts & Leaves: Community-Controlled Economic Infrastructure for Right Relationship*

## The Challenge We Face

Our economic systems reward extraction while making life-sustaining work invisible:

- **$10+ trillion in care work** annually goes unrecognized while speculation adds to GDP
- **Indigenous communities** face economic marginalization despite stewarding Earth's healthiest ecosystems  
- **Ecological restoration** costs money while ecosystem destruction generates profit
- **Community wealth** gets extracted to distant shareholders while local businesses struggle

**To:** Economic systems that circulate care and regenerate communities through Right Relationship

**The transformation from extraction to Right Relationship begins with each Hearts transaction that rewards care, each Leaves NFT that funds restoration, each community assembly that chooses cooperation over competition.**

**We have Indigenous wisdom. We have proven models. We have the technology.**

**The economics of Right Relationship begin now.**
