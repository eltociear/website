# Four-Layer Payout System: Recognizing All Forms of Wealth

> *"True wealth flows in rivers we have never learned to measure—the grandmother's wisdom shared over evening tea, the neighbor's help during illness, the forest's gift of clean air and water. Our economics must finally recognize what our hearts have always known: the most valuable work is often the most invisible."*

The AUBI payout system recognizes that human value extends far beyond market transactions, creating multiple pathways for economic participation that honor different forms of contribution while ensuring everyone's basic needs are met unconditionally. This four-layer architecture moves from philosophical foundation to practical implementation, transforming economic systems from scarcity-based competition to abundance-based cooperation through dual-track recognition of both professional care work and sacred community relationships.

## Layer 0: Relational Wealth (Philosophical Foundation)

**Layer 0** honors the unmonetized contributions that form the foundation of healthy communities—kinship care, spiritual guidance, cultural wisdom transmission, and countless daily acts of generosity that make life meaningful but never appear in economic accounting and should never be commodified.

### The Invisible Economy of Care

Every day, billions of people contribute to community wellbeing through activities that economists classify as externalities but that Indigenous wisdom recognizes as the heart of true wealth. Maya's grandmother teaching plant medicine knowledge to children creates relational wealth that no corporation can produce. Dr. Williams listening compassionately to patients experiencing trauma provides healing that extends far beyond medical treatment. Ambassador Chen's elder sharing stories that connect island history with climate resilience builds cultural wealth that preserves community identity across generations.

These contributions sustain communities but remain invisible to GDP calculations that only count monetary transactions. A grandmother caring for grandchildren while parents work registers as economic burden rather than wealth creation. Community members organizing mutual aid networks appear as unpaid labor rather than essential infrastructure. Elders sharing wisdom through storytelling seems economically irrelevant despite preserving knowledge that enables community survival.

**Relational wealth** encompasses all the ways people create value through relationship, care, and cultural transmission that make communities resilient, meaningful, and joyful. This wealth cannot be accumulated like money but grows stronger through sharing and circulation.

### Recognition Without Commodification

Layer 0 acknowledges relational wealth without forcing it into market frameworks that would destroy its essential nature. Some gifts become less valuable when monetized—the grandmother's wisdom loses power when treated as paid service rather than loving transmission between generations.

**Love Ledger Gratitude Tokens**: The Love Ledger enables communities to recognize relational wealth through non-monetized Gratitude Tokens that acknowledge contributions without creating payment obligations or transforming sacred relationships into economic transactions.

When Maya's grandmother shares traditional knowledge, community members can record gratitude that becomes visible to the community without transforming sacred teaching into economic transaction, while contributing qualitative data to Love, Meaning, and Connection Index measurements.

**Ceremonial Recognition**: Communities develop their own protocols for honoring relational wealth through traditional ceremonies, community gatherings, and cultural celebrations that recognize essential contributions while preserving their sacred or communal character.

**Pathways to Professional Recognition**: Layer 0 contributors receive priority access to Community Provider certification and pathways into formal Hearts economy participation when they choose to expand their economic involvement while maintaining the option to keep their contributions in the non-monetized realm.

### Cultural Adaptation and Protection

Different communities define relational wealth according to their values, traditions, and social structures. Arctic communities might emphasize ice knowledge sharing and seasonal survival skills. Desert communities might prioritize water stewardship wisdom and heat adaptation practices. Urban communities might focus on neighborhood network maintenance and cultural bridge-building.

Indigenous communities maintain full authority over which aspects of their relational wealth they choose to make visible through Love Ledger systems, with sacred knowledge remaining protected under traditional protocols regardless of economic recognition opportunities.

**Traditional Knowledge Sovereignty**: Layer 0 specifically protects traditional knowledge, spiritual practices, and cultural wisdom from commodification while enabling communities to receive recognition for cultural preservation work that benefits both local continuity and global resilience.

## Layer 1: Universal Baseline (Hybrid Fiat/Hearts)

**Layer 1** guarantees dignified survival for all adults through unconditional payments that eliminate survival anxiety and enable people to refuse exploitative work while participating in both traditional market economy and community care economy.

### Freedom from Survival Work

The universal baseline transforms the fundamental relationship between survival and work. Currently, most people work primarily to avoid homelessness, hunger, and medical bankruptcy rather than to contribute their authentic gifts to community wellbeing. This survival imperative forces people into jobs that may be meaningless, harmful, or exploitative while preventing them from offering their true talents.

Dr. Williams sees this dynamic constantly—patients choosing between medication and rent, families skipping medical care due to cost, healthcare workers burning out in understaffed systems because leaving means losing health insurance. The survival imperative degrades both worker dignity and service quality.

**Unconditional Economic Security**: Layer 1 provides sufficient income to meet basic needs in dignity without work requirements, means testing, or bureaucratic surveillance. This follows the Alaska Permanent Fund model where all residents receive annual dividends simply by living in the state, creating economic security that enables rather than constrains human potential.

Regional calculations ensure Layer 1 payments reflect local cost-of-living while maintaining living wage standards. Rural communities with lower cash costs but greater self-reliance needs receive resource access support. Urban communities with higher housing costs receive increased cash payments. Island communities with import dependencies receive supply chain security assistance.

### Hybrid Currency Implementation

Layer 1 operates through innovative currency mix that balances immediate purchasing power with community care economy participation:

**70% Traditional Currency**: Fiat payments ensure access to housing, healthcare, education, and other services priced in national currencies. This portion enables full participation in existing economic systems while communities develop Hearts-accepting Community Provider networks and services.

**30% Hearts Currency**: Hearts payments create access to care economy services provided by chartered Community Providers while building community economic sovereignty. Citizens use Hearts to access services from Community Health Providers, Cultural Education Cooperatives, Environmental Restoration Organizations, and other certified care economy institutions.

Maya's community uses Hearts payments to access traditional food system education, cultural language programs, and ecological restoration services provided by Community Providers that strengthen community identity while meeting practical needs through professional care work.

### Youth Integration and Civic Development

**Education Stipends**: Young people aged 16-18 receive education-focused support that can include formal schooling, apprenticeships, traditional knowledge learning, or community service programs. This ensures youth have time to develop their gifts rather than entering the workforce prematurely due to family economic pressure.

Youth stipends include both fiat and Hearts components, enabling young people to access both traditional educational services and community-based learning opportunities provided by Cultural Preservation Providers and Traditional Knowledge Cooperatives.

**Civic Internships**: Optional programs enable youth to contribute to community projects while learning governance, ecological stewardship, or cultural preservation skills through chartered Community Providers specializing in youth development and leadership training.

Ambassador Chen's island nation offers civic internships through Community Providers for coastal restoration, traditional navigation education, and climate adaptation planning that prepare youth for meaningful adult roles while addressing urgent community needs and earning Hearts compensation for participating organizations.

**Community Provider Youth Programs**: Youth development receives Hearts support through certified Community Providers that offer apprenticeships, cultural education, and skills development programs that connect traditional knowledge with contemporary innovation and community leadership.

### Work Liberation Foundation

Layer 1 provides the economic foundation for the Work in Liberation Framework's Community Work Teams by ensuring freedom from survival work. When basic needs are guaranteed, people can choose work based on passion, purpose, and community need rather than merely economic desperation.

This transforms employment relationships from coercion-based to contribution-based. Dr. Williams could reduce her clinical hours to focus on community health education through a Community Health Provider without risking her family's security. Maya could dedicate more time to traditional ecological knowledge preservation through a Cultural Heritage Cooperative without sacrificing her household's economic stability.

**Community Provider Employment**: Many community members find meaningful employment within chartered Community Providers that offer professional development, democratic workplace governance, and alignment between personal values and work contribution while earning stable income through Hearts redemption.

## Layer 2: Contribution & Development Bonus (Hearts Currency)

**Layer 2** rewards contributions to love, meaning, and connection through Hearts currency payments earned exclusively by **chartered Community Providers** that demonstrate authentic community benefit and Right Relationship alignment while maintaining professional standards and community accountability.

### Community Provider Model for Hearts Economy

**Institutional Hearts Earning**: Unlike traditional UBI systems where individuals earn supplemental income, AUBI's Layer 2 operates through chartered Community Providers—formal organizations, cooperatives, and institutions that earn Hearts through verified community service and care work.

Citizens access Layer 2 benefits by spending their Hearts allocations (from Layer 1 and personal purchases) on services provided by Community Providers specializing in love, meaning, and connection contributions. Providers then redeem accumulated Hearts at the Hearts Treasury for operational funding and staff compensation.

Dr. Williams works with a chartered Community Health Provider that earns Hearts for comprehensive health education, traditional medicine integration, preventive care programs, and community wellness initiatives. Community members use their Hearts to access these services, while the provider redeems Hearts for staff salaries, program funding, and facility maintenance.

**Proof of Care Verification**: Community Providers demonstrate impact through formal **Proof of Care** protocols that document community benefit, cultural appropriateness, Right Relationship alignment, and measurable contributions to Love, Meaning, and Connection Index improvements.

Verification includes community feedback collection, LMCI impact assessment, traditional authority consultation (for cultural programs), and ongoing performance monitoring that ensures Hearts circulation serves authentic community needs rather than performative activities.

### Love Contributions: Building Community Connection

Love contributions encompass activities provided by Community Providers that strengthen caring relationships and community solidarity, addressing the epidemic of loneliness and social isolation that undermines both individual wellbeing and collective resilience.

**Community Health Cooperatives**: Chartered health providers earn Hearts for comprehensive community health education, preventive care programs, traditional medicine integration, mental health support, and wellness promotion that serves community health rather than individual treatment maximization.

Maya's community includes a Community Health Cooperative that combines traditional plant medicine knowledge with contemporary health education, earning Hearts for programs that strengthen community health resilience while preserving traditional healing wisdom and practices.

**Care Service Organizations**: Professional caregiving cooperatives earn Hearts for child care, elder support, disability assistance, and family support services that enable community members to participate fully in economic and cultural life while ensuring care work receives professional compensation.

**Conflict Resolution Centers**: Community mediation organizations earn Hearts for restorative justice facilitation, conflict transformation, community healing programs, and peace-building initiatives that strengthen community solidarity and traditional justice approaches.

**Community Organizing Cooperatives**: Organizations supporting democratic participation, mutual aid coordination, civic engagement, and social change earn Hearts for building collective capacity that strengthens community self-governance and resilience.

### Meaning Contributions: Cultural and Spiritual Wealth

Meaning contributions address the crisis of purpose that affects communities when traditional cultures are displaced and spiritual practices marginalized by purely materialistic economic systems.

**Cultural Preservation Organizations**: Community Providers specializing in language revitalization, traditional arts education, ceremony facilitation, and cultural documentation earn Hearts for work that preserves community identity while contributing to global cultural diversity.

Indigenous communities operate Cultural Heritage Cooperatives that earn Hearts for language immersion programs, traditional knowledge transmission, ceremonial leadership training, and cultural adaptation initiatives that strengthen traditional practices while addressing contemporary challenges.

**Knowledge Sharing Cooperatives**: Educational organizations earn Hearts for teaching traditional and contemporary knowledge through formal and informal channels, including traditional craft instruction, ecological knowledge transmission, spiritual guidance, and skills development programs.

**Spiritual Care Organizations**: Community Providers offering spiritual support, ceremony facilitation, interfaith dialogue, and meaning-making assistance earn Hearts within culturally appropriate boundaries that respect traditional protocols governing spiritual practices and religious authority.

**Artistic Expression Collectives**: Cultural organizations supporting community art creation, music education, storytelling programs, and creative expression earn Hearts for enriching community life through collaborative artistic programs rather than individual artistic production.

### Connection Contributions: Ecological Stewardship

Connection contributions reward activities provided by Community Providers that restore and maintain healthy relationships between human communities and natural systems, addressing climate change through regenerative practices rather than merely technological solutions.

**Ecological Restoration Organizations**: Environmental cooperatives earn Hearts and Leaves tokens for habitat restoration, species protection, ecosystem repair, and environmental education that combines traditional knowledge with contemporary restoration science under community control.

Maya's community operates a Marine Restoration Cooperative that earns Hearts and Leaves for coral reef restoration combining traditional knowledge with contemporary marine science, providing ecological education programs and community-controlled restoration that serves both local resilience and global marine ecosystem health.

**Food Sovereignty Cooperatives**: Agricultural organizations earn Hearts for developing local food systems, seed preservation programs, regenerative agriculture education, and food justice initiatives that strengthen community resilience while reducing dependence on industrial agriculture.

**Renewable Energy Cooperatives**: Community-controlled energy organizations earn Hearts and Leaves for renewable energy development, energy efficiency education, and energy democracy programs that build community energy sovereignty while reducing fossil fuel dependence.

**Climate Adaptation Organizations**: Community Providers specializing in climate resilience, disaster preparedness, and adaptation planning earn Hearts and Leaves for programs that strengthen community capacity to thrive during climate change while maintaining cultural continuity.

### Community Provider Certification and Performance

**Certification Requirements**: Organizations seeking Community Provider status undergo comprehensive assessment for community benefit demonstration, cultural sensitivity training, Right Relationship alignment, democratic governance structures, and operational capacity for Hearts-based service delivery.

Certification involves community consultation processes, Indigenous leadership approval where appropriate, ongoing performance monitoring, and community accountability mechanisms that ensure providers serve authentic community needs rather than extracting community resources.

**Performance Monitoring**: Community Providers undergo regular community evaluation through traditional governance processes, LMCI impact assessment, cultural appropriateness review, and financial transparency auditing to maintain certification and Hearts earning capacity.

Ambassador Chen's island nation includes Community Providers for traditional navigation education, coastal restoration, cultural ceremony facilitation, and climate adaptation planning that undergo annual community review to ensure cultural protocols are respected and community priorities are served.

**Community Accountability**: Citizens provide feedback on Community Provider services through both formal evaluation processes and Love Ledger Gratitude Tokens, creating dual-track accountability that honors both professional service standards and traditional recognition methods.

## Layer 3: Equity & Needs-Based Supplement (Hearts Currency)

**Layer 3** addresses systemic inequities and provides additional support for health needs, caregiving responsibilities, and reparations for historical harms, ensuring that economic transformation serves justice rather than perpetuating existing inequalities.

### Addressing Systemic Inequities

Economic transformation must actively address rather than ignore the historical and ongoing inequities that concentrate wealth among privileged groups while marginalizing others based on race, gender, disability status, geographic location, and other factors beyond individual control.

**Disability Justice Support**: Additional Hearts payments ensure people with disabilities have full economic participation through enhanced access to Community Provider services including personal assistance, accessibility technology, adaptive equipment, and disability justice advocacy organizations.

This includes recognition that disability communities contribute wisdom about interdependence, alternative ways of organizing social life, and community care systems that benefit everyone while requiring additional support for full economic participation.

**Caregiving Intensification Support**: Families caring for multiple dependents, single parents, and others with intensive caregiving responsibilities receive additional Hearts allocations that enable them to access enhanced Community Provider support including respite care, family support services, and caregiver education programs.

Dr. Williams advocates for patients whose caregiving responsibilities prevent standard employment but whose care work constitutes skilled labor deserving recognition and support through Community Provider family services and caregiver support organizations.

**Community Provider Accessibility**: Layer 3 funding ensures Community Providers maintain universal accessibility regardless of individual ability to pay Hearts, creating subsidization systems that ensure no community member is excluded from care services due to economic circumstances.

### Geographic and Climate Justice

**Geographic Equity**: Communities in remote locations with higher living costs or limited economic opportunities receive additional Hearts allocations that enable them to access Community Provider services while maintaining their cultural practices and ecological stewardship without forced migration to urban centers.

**Climate Reparations**: Communities most affected by climate change despite contributing least to emissions receive priority access to Layer 3 support for adaptation projects, emergency response, and economic transition assistance through Environmental Justice Community Providers.

Ambassador Chen's island nation receives climate reparations funding that supports Community Providers for sea level rise adaptation, coral restoration, traditional knowledge preservation, and climate refugee support that enable community survival while maintaining cultural sovereignty.

**Infrastructure Investment**: Layer 3 includes funding for community infrastructure that enables Community Provider operation including renewable energy systems, communication technology, transportation networks, and shared facilities that benefit everyone while requiring collective investment.

### Restorative Justice Implementation

**Historical Harm Redress**: Layer 3 includes specific reparations protocols for communities harmed by slavery, colonization, genocide, and other systematic injustices through enhanced Hearts allocations that support Community Providers specializing in historical trauma healing, cultural revitalization, and economic sovereignty building.

Indigenous communities receive additional Hearts support for Community Providers focused on land restoration, language revitalization, traditional governance strengthening, and cultural healing that address ongoing impacts of colonization while building future resilience.

**Community Healing Organizations**: Funding for Community Providers specializing in trauma-informed community programs, traditional healing practices, restorative justice processes, and collective healing that address both individual and collective healing needed for communities to thrive rather than merely survive.

Maya's community receives Layer 3 support for Cultural Healing Cooperatives that address intergenerational trauma from forced assimilation while strengthening traditional cultural practices through professional healing services that honor traditional protocols while providing contemporary trauma support.

**Truth and Reconciliation Support**: Community Providers specializing in truth-telling, reconciliation processes, and historical justice advocacy receive Hearts support for work that addresses systematic injustices while building community capacity for healing and prevention of future harm.

### Health and Wellness Integration

**Community Health Equity**: Additional Hearts support ensures universal healthcare access through Community Health Providers regardless of employment status or ability to pay, integrating traditional healing practices with biomedical care according to community preferences and cultural protocols.

**Mental Health and Spiritual Care**: Recognition that mental health includes spiritual and cultural dimensions often ignored by purely biomedical approaches, with funding for Community Providers offering traditional healing practices, community support networks, and culturally appropriate mental health services.

**Community Wellness Infrastructure**: Investment in shared resources that promote collective health through Community Providers including community gardens, recreational facilities, gathering spaces, and healing centers that enable community connection and mutual support.

## Gaming Prevention and Community Accountability

All layers include sophisticated safeguards ensuring authentic contribution recognition while preventing exploitation or gaming of the system through both technological monitoring and community governance.

### Community Provider Accountability Systems

**Proof of Care Verification**: Community Providers must demonstrate authentic impact through comprehensive documentation including community feedback, LMCI measurement, cultural appropriateness assessment, and traditional authority consultation where appropriate.

**Community Validation Networks**: Local communities verify Community Provider performance through traditional governance processes, Love Ledger feedback systems, and formal evaluation procedures that ensure services serve authentic community needs rather than Hearts maximization.

**Transparent Appeals Process**: Clear procedures enable individuals and communities to challenge Community Provider certification, report service inadequacies, or contest Hearts allocation decisions, with appeals reviewed by diverse panels including Indigenous knowledge keepers and community representatives.

Maya's community demonstrates accountability through quarterly Community Provider evaluation assemblies where community members assess service quality, cultural appropriateness, and community benefit while providing guidance for service improvement and Hearts allocation adjustment.

### Anti-Exploitation Safeguards

**Community Sovereignty Protection**: Protection against external pressure on communities to establish specific types of Community Providers or modify traditional practices to earn Hearts, maintaining community autonomy over economic participation choices and cultural adaptation decisions.

**Traditional Knowledge Protection**: Safeguards preventing Community Providers from appropriating or commercializing traditional knowledge without proper protocols, community consent, and ongoing benefit-sharing arrangements that respect traditional knowledge sovereignty.

**Democratic Governance Requirements**: Community Providers must demonstrate democratic governance structures, worker rights protection, and community accountability mechanisms that prevent internal exploitation while ensuring Hearts circulation serves community empowerment rather than organizational power concentration.

Ambassador Chen's island nation requires Community Providers to operate through traditional governance protocols where appropriate, ensuring that ecological restoration and cultural preservation work strengthens rather than undermines traditional authority and community decision-making systems.

### Cultural Adaptation Requirements

**Indigenous Sovereignty Compliance**: All Community Provider certification processes must accommodate Indigenous governance protocols, traditional knowledge sovereignty, and cultural self-determination requirements rather than imposing external standards that ignore traditional governance systems.

**FPIC 2.0 Implementation**: Community Providers operating in Indigenous territories must demonstrate Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 compliance with ongoing community consent rather than one-time approval, ensuring traditional authority over cultural and ecological work.

**Red Lines Clause Protection**: Communities maintain authority to withdraw Community Provider certification or modify services if activities threaten cultural integrity, traditional knowledge sovereignty, or ecological relationships, regardless of Hearts earning potential.

## **The four-layer system transforms economics from scarcity-based competition to abundance-based cooperation through dual-track recognition that honors both professional care work and sacred community relationships. The Community Provider model ensures that Hearts circulation serves authentic community benefit while protecting traditional knowledge and relational wealth from commodification.**

**This architecture enables communities to implement economic transformation today while building toward planetary coordination that serves rather than exploits human potential and ecological systems. The separation of monetized professional care work from non-monetized relational wealth ensures that economic security serves community flourishing while preserving the sacred dimensions of community life that should never become commodities.**
