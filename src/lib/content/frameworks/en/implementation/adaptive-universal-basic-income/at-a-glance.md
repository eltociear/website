## **AUBI: At a Glance 🌱**

What if our economy valued care, creativity, and a healthy planet? That's the vision of the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)—a dual-track economic system that provides security for everyone while honoring both professional care work and sacred community relationships.

#### **What is it?** 💖
A revolutionary economic system that provides a **safety net** for everyone while creating **launching pads** for you to contribute your unique gifts through two complementary pathways: professional care services and community recognition.

#### **How Do You Participate?** 🤝
AUBI works through **two interconnected tracks** that honor different forms of value:

**Track 1: Hearts Economy** 💛
Professional care services provided by certified Community Providers:
* **Your Foundation to Live**: Universal baseline income (70% traditional money, 30% Hearts currency) with no strings attached
* **Professional Care Access**: Use your Hearts to access services from Community Health Providers, Cultural Education Cooperatives, Environmental Restoration Organizations
* **Community Provider Work**: Join or create certified organizations that earn Hearts by providing authentic care services
* **Hearts Treasury Support**: Community Providers convert Hearts to operational funding through local credit unions

**Track 2: Love Ledger Recognition** ❤️
Sacred community relationships honored without commercialization:
* **Your Community's Heartbeat**: Simple acts of kindness, wisdom sharing, and cultural transmission recognized through Gratitude Tokens
* **Traditional Knowledge Sharing**: Elder teachings, cultural practices, and spiritual guidance honored without payment
* **Relationship Documentation**: Care networks, mentorship, and community connections strengthened through recognition
* **Cultural Protection**: Sacred knowledge and traditional relationships protected from commercialization

#### **How Does it Work?** 🌍
* **Hearts Currency**: Supports professional care economy through certified Community Providers who convert Hearts to operational funding via the **Hearts Treasury**
* **Gratitude Tokens**: Honor informal care and traditional knowledge through the **Love Ledger** without any monetary value
* **Community Governed**: Indigenous-led **Social Resilience Council** with Earth Council veto power ensures both systems serve Right Relationship
* **Dual Success Measurement**: **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)** measures what really matters using data from both professional services and community relationships

#### **Starting Today: The Grassroots Path** 🌱
Communities can begin immediately through the **BAZ Starter Pack**:
1. **Convening Circle**: Small group identifies local care needs and traditional relationships to honor
2. **Proto-Treasury**: Simple shared bank account proves Hearts economy concepts on small scale
3. **Provider Recruitment**: Develop Community Providers with existing community trust and cultural competency  
4. **BAZ Council**: Formal governance elected only after demonstrating success and community validation

#### **Why Two Tracks?** 🤔
* **Professional Care Deserves Payment**: Healthcare workers, cultural educators, and environmental restorers need sustainable income
* **Sacred Relationships Stay Sacred**: Grandmother's wisdom and community kindness should never become commodities
* **Both Create Wealth**: Economic security through services + cultural vitality through relationships = thriving communities
* **Community Control**: You choose how to participate in both professional services and traditional recognition

#### **Real Examples** 🌟
* **Maya's Island Community**: Marine Restoration Cooperative earns Hearts for coral restoration while Love Ledger honors traditional fishing wisdom
* **Dr. Williams' Healthcare**: Community Health Provider earns Hearts for wellness education while Love Ledger recognizes informal patient support
* **Ambassador Chen's Adaptation**: Climate Adaptation Provider earns Hearts for resilience planning while Love Ledger honors traditional navigation knowledge

**AUBI creates an economy where everyone doesn't just survive—they flourish through both professional opportunity and community recognition, guided by Indigenous wisdom and Right Relationship with all life.**
