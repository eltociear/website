> *"The land does not belong to us; we belong to the land. The city does not sit upon the territory; it grows from the territory like a tree from soil. When governance remembers this relationship, every decision becomes a ceremony, every policy becomes a prayer, and every community becomes a keeper of the sacred trust between all beings who call this place home."*

### Understanding Indigenous Territorial Rights

**Territorial Recognition Framework**: Indigenous territorial sovereignty is not a political opinion or cultural preference—it is a **legal and spiritual reality** that predates all colonial governments and municipal boundaries. The Bioregional Polis operates from the fundamental recognition that most cities exist on **unceded Indigenous territories** with Indigenous communities maintaining inherent governance rights.

**Legal Foundation**: Indigenous territorial rights are recognized in international law through the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**, specifically:
- **Article 26**: Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired
- **Article 27**: States shall establish and implement, in conjunction with Indigenous peoples concerned, a fair, independent, impartial, open and transparent process to recognize and adjudicate the rights of Indigenous peoples pertaining to their lands, territories and resources

**Spiritual and Cultural Foundation**: Indigenous territorial relationships extend far beyond Western property concepts to encompass **spiritual responsibility**, **cultural identity**, and **intergenerational obligation**. The land is not owned but held in trust for future generations, with governance responsibilities flowing from this sacred relationship.
