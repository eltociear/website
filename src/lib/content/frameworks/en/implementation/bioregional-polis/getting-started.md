## <a id="know-your-territory"></a>First Steps: Know Your Territory

### Territorial Acknowledgment & Relationship

Before any implementation begins, **understand whose traditional territory you are on** and what relationships already exist between Indigenous communities and urban systems in your bioregion.

**Research Traditional Territories**
- Identify Indigenous nations, tribes, and communities with historical and ongoing connections to your urban area
- Learn about traditional governance systems, ecological knowledge, and cultural protocols
- Understand treaty relationships, land claims, and current sovereignty struggles

**Assess Current Relationships**
- What existing partnerships exist between Indigenous communities and municipal governments?
- How are Indigenous communities currently represented (or excluded) in urban governance?
- What conflicts or tensions exist around land use, development, or cultural recognition?
- What collaborative successes can be built upon?

**Honor Existing Leadership**
- Indigenous communities may already be leading urban transformation efforts
- Traditional knowledge holders may have solutions you haven't considered
- Youth from Indigenous communities may be organizing for change
- Respect existing initiatives rather than starting competing efforts

### Bioregional Ecosystem Assessment

**Understand Your Watershed**
- Map the rivers, streams, and water systems flowing through your urban area

- Identify upstream and downstream communities affected by urban activities
- Research seasonal patterns, wildlife corridors, and migration routes

**Assess Ecological Health**
- Current biodiversity levels and native species populations
- Air and water quality challenges and improvement opportunities  
- Urban heat island effects and climate vulnerability
- Existing green infrastructure and restoration potential

**Map Food & Resource Flows**
- Where does your city's food, energy, and materials come from?
- What are the social and ecological impacts of these supply chains?
- What local and regional production capacity exists or could be developed?
- How do resource flows affect Indigenous territories and communities?

### Cultural & Social Landscape Mapping

**Understand Community Composition**
- Who lives in your city and what communities do they belong to?
- What languages are spoken and what cultural traditions are practiced?

### Asserting Sovereignty & Leadership

Indigenous communities are not stakeholders in this framework—you are the **primary decision-makers** about whether, how, and to what extent to engage with urban transformation initiatives on your traditional territories.

**Know Your Rights & Authority**
- **Territorial Sovereignty**: Your inherent rights to govern traditional territories, including urban areas

## <a id="building-alliances"></a>Building Alliances Across Difference

### Principles for Authentic Alliance Building

**Center Those Most Affected**
- Indigenous communities have primary authority over framework implementation on traditional territories
- Communities of color, disabled people, LGBTQ+ people, and other marginalized communities lead on issues affecting them
- Working-class and poor communities have authority over economic development affecting their neighborhoods
- Alliance building amplifies rather than co-opts the leadership of most affected communities

**Address Power Differences Honestly**
- Acknowledge different communities' access to resources, political influence, and social privileges
- Create structures that redistribute rather than reinforce existing power imbalances
- Address conflicts and tensions constructively rather than avoiding them or imposing false unity
- Build accountability systems that allow marginalized communities to challenge privileged communities when they cause harm

**Honor Cultural Differences & Sovereignty**
- Respect different communities' distinct cultural practices, governance systems, and organizing traditions
- Avoid cultural appropriation while creating space for respectful cultural exchange and learning
- Support communities' self-determination rather than trying to merge all communities into single organizations
- Recognize that some communities may need separate organizing spaces while still building alliances for shared goals

### Coalition Building Strategies

**Issue-Based Coalition Building**
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Non-Indigenous communities support Indigenous land rights, treaty rights, and self-determination
- **Community Ownership**: Multi-racial coalitions for community land trusts, cooperative development, and democratic economics
- **Environmental Justice**: Alliances connecting environmental protection with racial and economic justice
- **Municipal Democracy**: Cross-community organizing for participatory governance and community control over municipal resources

**Mutual Aid & Solidarity Economy**

- **Shared Learning**: Educational events that bring different communities together to learn about framework implementation and organizing strategies
- **Storytelling & Narrative**: Sharing stories across communities that build empathy and understanding while respecting communities' authority over their own narratives

### Addressing Common Alliance Challenges

**White Supremacy & Racism**
- Acknowledge how racism affects alliance building and community development work
- Center leadership by Indigenous people and people of color while creating meaningful roles for white people as allies
- Address racist patterns in organizational culture, decision-making, and resource distribution
- Create accountability processes that allow communities of color to address racist harm and demand changes

**Class Differences & Economic Inequality**
- Recognize how class differences affect communities' capacity to participate in organizing and development work
- Ensure that alliance activities are accessible to working-class and poor community members
- Address class-based assumptions about organizing strategies, timeline, and priorities
- Create economic support systems that allow low-income community members to participate meaningfully

## **Conclusion: Your Journey Begins with Relationship**

The Bioregional Polis framework offers pathways for transforming cities into regenerative, democratic, and Indigenous-honoring communities. But implementation always begins with the same first step: **building authentic relationships** with the people and place where you are.

**Start where you are**: You don't need to wait for perfect conditions or complete understanding. Begin with listening, learning, and building relationships with Indigenous communities, community organizations, and the more-than-human world around you.

**Honor Indigenous leadership**: Indigenous communities are not stakeholders in this work—they are the primary decision-makers about transformation on their traditional territories. Follow their lead and support their sovereignty.

**Build community power**: Transformation happens through community organizing and collective action, not through individual heroism or expert solutions. Focus on building relationships and shared power.

**Think seven generations**: Every action you take today affects the communities and ecosystems of the future. Let long-term thinking guide your choices while taking concrete action now.

**Trust the process**: Regenerative transformation is not a linear process with predictable timelines. Trust that authentic relationship building and community organizing will create the conditions for deeper change.

**The future of cities depends on whether we can remember that cities are not machines to be optimized, but living communities to be nurtured in right relationship with the land and all our relations.**

**Your bioregion is calling you home. How will you answer?**
