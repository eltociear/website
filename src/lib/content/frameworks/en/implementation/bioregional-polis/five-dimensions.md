### Integration Principles

**Centering Indigenous Leadership**: Every dimension operates under Indigenous territorial authority with FPIC 2.0 protocols and traditional knowledge integration.

**Democratic Participation**: All tools, systems, and policies designed to enhance rather than replace human wisdom and community decision-making capacity.

**Ecological Integrity**: Each dimension contributes to regenerative outcomes within planetary boundaries and bioregional health.

**Cosmic Connection**: Recognition that urban systems exist within larger cosmic cycles, honoring Indigenous astronomical traditions and natural light rhythms.

**Systems Coherence**: Dimensions work together synergistically, with policies in one area supporting rather than undermining others.

**Cultural Responsiveness**: Implementation approaches adapted to local cultural contexts while maintaining universal principles of justice and sustainability.
