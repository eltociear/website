# Bioregional Polis At-a-Glance
*An Indigenous-Guided Urban Framework*

## The Vision in One Sentence
Transform cities into regenerative ecosystems guided by Indigenous wisdom, where citizens govern through bioregional democracy within Indigenous-led territories.

## What It Is
A comprehensive framework reimagining urban governance as living covenants between human and non-human communities, rooted in Indigenous stewardship and powered by regenerative economics.

## The Challenge We Address
- Cities consume 78% of global energy and produce 70% of carbon emissions
- Current urban systems disconnect communities from bioregional foundations
- Urban governance often excludes Indigenous voices despite territorial sovereignty
- Environmental degradation accelerates while social inequity deepens

## Our Core Innovation: The Indigenous-Led Citizen Assembly
**40% Indigenous representatives + 30% community members + 20% youth + 10% urban ecologists**

Operating through ceremonial governance with FPIC 2.0 protocols and veto power over decisions affecting traditional territories.

## Five Functional Dimensions

### 🏛️ **1. Heart of Governance**
Indigenous-Led Citizen Assemblies with ceremonial decision-making, FPIC 2.0 protocols, and Earth Council oversight

### 💰 **2. Economy of the Polis** 
Hearts/Leaves currencies reward civic participation, Global Urban Fund prioritizes Indigenous-led BAZs, universal basic services

### ⚖️ **3. Legal Power**
Ecosystem personhood by 2035, Digital Justice Tribunal enforcement, mandatory equity audits for disability and gender justice

### 💻 **4. Digital Tools**
Ethical AI governance, Indigenous data sovereignty, digital twins under Global Data Commons Trust

### 🌱 **5. Vision in Action**
15-minute cities, biophilic design, climate adaptation, urban sanctuaries, universal access

## Key Outcomes by 2040
- **🌿 30% increase** in native urban species
- **🚶 100% of residents** within 1km of essential services
- **♿ 100% universal access** to basic services
- **🌡️ 50% reduction** in urban heat
- **🌍 50% of cities** with wildlife sanctuary networks
- **♻️ 90% of cities** achieving zero waste

## How It Works

### **Foundation**: Indigenous Sovereignty
All urban governance operates within Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) under Earth Council moral authority

### **Economics**: Regenerative Incentives
Hearts/Leaves currencies logged in Love Ledger reward:
- Civic participation in assemblies
- Urban gardening and stewardship
- Cultural festivals and ceremonies
- Biophilic business practices

### **Technology**: Ethical & Inclusive
- AI governance under Aurora Accord
- Indigenous data sovereignty protocols
- Low-tech alternatives for digital equity
- Community-controlled monitoring systems

### **Justice**: Rights for All Beings
- Legal personhood for urban ecosystems
- Disability Impact Assessments for all policies
- Gender/queer spatial justice audits
- Youth veto power on long-term decisions

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Years | Key Milestones |
