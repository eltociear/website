> *"A framework is like a river channel—it guides the flow of energy and resources while allowing the water to remain water. The strongest frameworks are those that work with natural patterns rather than against them, supporting life's tendency toward complexity, beauty, and regeneration. Like the stars that guide travelers across vast distances, our principles must be both constant and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of transformation."*
