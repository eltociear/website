> *"Every transformation begins with a single step rooted in right relationship. The path from extractive urban systems to regenerative bioregional democracy is not walked alone—it is a community journey guided by Indigenous wisdom, supported by traditional governance, and nurtured by the patient work of building new relationships with land and each other."*
