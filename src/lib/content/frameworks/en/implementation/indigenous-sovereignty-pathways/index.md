## <a id="overview"></a>Framework Overview

In a world facing ecological collapse and spiritual disconnection, Indigenous peoples and communities worldwide are already leading the work of regeneration and healing. As a non-Indigenous organization focused on regenerative systems, we humbly offer this framework as one possible pathway for supporting and learning from Indigenous sovereignty, ecological wisdom, and traditional governance systems.

**Our Position & Approach**

This framework is presented as an invitation for dialogue and co-creation, recognizing Indigenous peoples not as stakeholders to consult, but as the primary teachers and decision-makers in any genuine transformation. Rooted in principles of decolonization, it suggests ways that Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Indigenous sovereignty might inform planetary stewardship—always with the understanding that such integration must emerge from Indigenous leadership.

Rather than prescribing solutions, we present possibilities for how bioregional governance, rights of nature, and ceremonial stewardship might be woven together. These concepts are offered as starting points for conversation, adaptation, or complete reimagining according to the protocols and priorities of Indigenous communities themselves.

### Version 1.0: A Draft for Community Dialogue

This document is the first draft (Version 1.0), now ready for community dialogue and review. It has been developed through extensive research guided by Indigenous governance principles from around the world. All elements are offered in the spirit of learning and service, with the understanding that authentic transformation must be Indigenous-led at every level.

**An Invitation for Indigenous Community Review**

This draft is explicitly shared for review, feedback, and guidance from Indigenous communities, traditional knowledge keepers, and cultural authorities. A core principle of this work is the **Red Lines Clause**, which ensures Indigenous communities retain complete authority over their engagement and can modify, disregard, or withdraw from any part of this framework. We recognize that authentic transformation must be Indigenous-led at every level.

**On Readiness and Right Timing**

Should any community find these ideas resonant enough to explore further, we trust and affirm that all such explorations will be guided by their own traditional governance systems. The path forward, including any consideration of pilot implementations, naturally begins with a community's own timing, elder consultation, and cultural protocols.

**Guiding Vision & Core Concepts for Exploration**

This work is inspired by a vision of profound transformation. It invites us to ask: *What if planetary governance could emerge from regenerative, Indigenous-led stewardship? What if our economies, technologies, and legal systems were guided by the wisdom of Traditional Ecological Knowledge?*

**Examples of Transformative Possibilities**

Instead of setting predetermined targets, we offer these as examples of the kinds of life-affirming outcomes that could emerge from such a transformation:

- The flourishing of biodiversity within sovereign Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).
- The revitalization of Indigenous languages and cultural practices.
- The rematriation of significant land areas to Indigenous stewardship.
- The establishment of meaningful reparative agreements and flows of resources for regeneration.
- The global adoption of well-being metrics, like Gross Planetary Health, to guide our collective decisions.

**Core Concepts for Exploration**

To spark this conversation, this framework offers several core concepts for discussion, adaptation, or reimagining:

- **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)** with Indigenous sovereignty and ecosystem-based governance.
- An **Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)** to provide moral guidance and planetary coordination.
- **Traditional Knowledge Protection** through new forms of data sovereignty.
- **Regenerative Economics** centered on well-being metrics and ecological reparations.
- **Indigenous AI Governance** to ensure technology is guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge.
- A transition toward **Ceremonial Stewardship** and ritual-based governance.
- **Comprehensive Safeguards** including the Red Lines Clause and cultural integrity protocols.
- **Intergenerational Accountability** through long-term foresight and future-generations tribunals.

## <a id="exploring"></a>Exploring the Framework's Concepts

The ideas in this repository are organized into the following sections for exploration. Each one is offered as a starting point for dialogue.

0.  **[Preamble: A Framework Born from the Land](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/preamble)**: *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the Earth, and the Word was the Earth speaking."* — An introduction to the framework's origins and guidance for engagement.

1.  **[Core Principles](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/core-principles)**: *"We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children."* — Discussing foundational values like bioregional governance, non-human rights, and seventh-generation accountability.

2.  **[Structural Components]/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/structural-components**: *"Listen to the wind, it talks. Listen to the silence, it speaks."* — Exploring concepts like an Earth Council, Bioregional Autonomous Zones, and Traditional Knowledge protection.

3.  **[Pathways from Vision to Action](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/pathways-from-vision-to-action)**: *"Plant the seeds today for the forest of tomorrow."* — Discussing possible pathways and considerations for bringing regenerative ideas to life.

4.  **[Key Mechanisms & Concepts](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/key-mechanisms)**: *"Technology must serve the Earth, not rule it."* — Presenting examples of tools and ideas, such as decentralized knowledge libraries and Indigenous AI governance.

5.  **[A Vision of Flourishing](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/vision-of-flourishing)**: *"When we heal the Earth, we heal ourselves."* — Exploring what successful ecological regeneration and cultural revitalization could look like.

6.  **[Engaging with Existing Systems](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/interface-existing-systems)**: *"Walk softly, for the Earth is sacred."* — A discussion on how these ideas might interface with structures like UNDRIP and international law.

7.  **[Pathways for Broader Engagement](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/pathways-broader-engagement)**: *"Stories carry the wisdom of our ancestors."* — Ideas for allied engagement, youth education, and building partnerships.

8.  **[Supporting Materials & Considerations](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/supporting-materials-considerations)**: *"Wisdom is knowing the path and preparing for its challenges."* — A collection of case studies, a discussion of potential challenges, and examples of success metrics.

9.  **[System Map and Visual Integration](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/system-map-visual)**: *"The web of life connects us all."* — A visualization of how these concepts can interconnect.

10. **[Glossary and References](/frameworks/indigenous-sovereignty-pathways/glossary-references)**: *"Words carry the spirit of our intentions."* — Definitions of essential terminology and conceptual foundations.

## <a id="library"></a>A Library of Patterns & Starting Points

To bridge vision with practice, this repository includes a collection of patterns, concepts, and starting points for discussion. These are not off-the-shelf templates, but rather examples of the types of agreements, protocols, and resources that communities might choose to develop for themselves. Each concept is an invitation to a deeper conversation.

**Examples of Governance Patterns & Concepts:**

* **Cooperative Agreements:** Exploring frameworks for building robust, respectful agreements between Indigenous nations and other governing bodies like municipalities.
* **Bioregional Readiness:** Discussing pathways and considerations for communities exploring greater autonomy (BAZs).
* **Protecting Traditional Knowledge:** Methods for documenting and safeguarding traditional knowledge according to community protocols.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Principles and models for ensuring Indigenous communities own and control their own data.

**Examples of Economic & Legal Concepts:**

* **Ecological Reparations:** Frameworks for conceptualizing and pursuing reparations for historical and ecological harm.
* **Land Rematriation:** Exploring strategies and models for returning land to Indigenous stewardship.
* **Rights of Nature:** Legal and philosophical approaches for embedding the rights of ecosystems into governance.

**Examples of Technology & Cultural Concepts:**

* **Indigenous AI Governance:** Ethical protocols for guiding the development of artificial intelligence in alignment with Traditional Ecological Knowledge.
* **Cultural Integrity:** Discussing methods for ensuring traditions can be shared and adapted while maintaining their core integrity.
* **Ceremonial Governance:** Exploring how ritual and ceremony can be integrated into modern decision-making processes.

## <a id="invitation"></a>An Invitation for Conversation & Collaboration

This collection of ideas is offered as a starting point for a conversation. We believe that the most valuable knowledge and the most effective pathways will emerge from dialogue, shared stories, and collaboration.
