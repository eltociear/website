**Indigenous Media Sovereignty Reminder**: All media strategy and content creation must operate under Indigenous governance and traditional authority. Communities maintain exclusive control over their narratives, Traditional Knowledge sharing, and media representation. No external organization can develop Indigenous media strategy without appropriate community invitation and ongoing traditional governance oversight.

**Cultural Protocol Supremacy**: Traditional cultural protocols and sacred knowledge boundaries always take precedence over media strategy requirements. Media engagement must strengthen traditional governance and cultural practices, never compromise them for external audience engagement.

**Red Lines Protection**: Indigenous communities maintain authority to modify, withdraw from, or redirect media engagement if it threatens cultural integrity or becomes co-opted by external interests seeking to control Indigenous narratives.
