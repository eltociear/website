# Reparations Calculation & Campaign Toolkit
*Justice is Returning What Was Taken: A Framework for Indigenous Reparations*

> *"Justice is returning what was taken. The Earth remembers every theft, every wound, every healing. Now we demand the balance be restored."*  
> — Lakota teaching

## Purpose and Overview

This comprehensive toolkit provides Indigenous communities, advocates, and allies with frameworks for calculating reparations owed to Indigenous peoples and strategies for campaigning for "Reparations for Regeneration"—the return of resources stolen through colonization for Indigenous-led ecological restoration and cultural revitalization. The toolkit addresses historical and ongoing extraction while providing practical mechanisms for achieving material justice.

**What are Indigenous Reparations?**
Indigenous reparations represent comprehensive compensation for historical and ongoing colonization, including land theft, resource extraction, cultural genocide, and environmental destruction. Reparations go beyond symbolic gestures to provide material resources enabling Indigenous communities to restore traditional territories, revitalize cultures, and lead planetary healing initiatives.

**Core Principles**:
- **Historical Accountability**: Recognition and compensation for 500+ years of colonial extraction and genocide
- **Ongoing Harm Recognition**: Acknowledgment that colonization continues through extractive industries and cultural oppression
- **Indigenous Leadership**: Reparations designed and managed by Indigenous communities under traditional governance
- **Regenerative Purpose**: Reparations directed toward ecological restoration and cultural revitalization rather than individual payments
- **Systemic Transformation**: Reparations contributing to fundamental transformation from extraction to regeneration

**Campaign Goals**:
- **$1 Trillion by 2035** in comprehensive reparations from colonial governments and extractive corporations
- **Land Rematriation**: Return of 50% of traditional territories to Indigenous stewardship by 2040
- **Fossil Fuel Subsidy Redirection**: $1 trillion in fossil fuel subsidies redirected to Indigenous-led regenerative projects
- **Cultural Revitalization**: Comprehensive funding for Indigenous language revitalization and traditional knowledge transmission
- **Ecological Restoration**: Indigenous-led ecosystem restoration replacing extractive industries

## Part I: Reparations Calculation Framework

### Section 1: Historical Carbon Emissions Debt

#### 1.1 Carbon Emissions Accountability Framework

**Climate Debt Calculation Methodology**:
Comprehensive accounting of historical carbon emissions by colonial governments and corporations, with reparations calculated based on damage to Indigenous territories and contribution to climate change affecting Indigenous communities.

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Carbon Reparations = Historical Emissions (tons CO2) × $100/ton × Indigenous Impact Multiplier
```

**Historical Emissions Accounting (1850-2025)**:
- **United States**: 400 billion tons CO2 = $40 trillion base calculation
- **European Union**: 350 billion tons CO2 = $35 trillion base calculation  
- **China**: 250 billion tons CO2 = $25 trillion base calculation
- **Russia**: 100 billion tons CO2 = $10 trillion base calculation
- **Canada**: 25 billion tons CO2 = $2.5 trillion base calculation
- **Australia**: 20 billion tons CO2 = $2 trillion base calculation

**Indigenous Impact Multiplier Factors**:
- [ ] **Traditional Territory Impact**: Multiplier based on percentage of traditional territories affected by climate change
- [ ] **Cultural Practice Disruption**: Additional compensation for climate impacts on traditional hunting, fishing, gathering, and ceremonial practices
- [ ] **Forced Migration**: Compensation for climate-induced displacement from traditional territories
