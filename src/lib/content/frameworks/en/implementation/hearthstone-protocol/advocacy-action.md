# Advocacy & Action

**The Defining Choice of Our Time**: Property relations are not neutral—they determine whether land serves life or extraction, whether communities control their territories or face displacement, and whether economies regenerate ecosystems or accelerate their collapse. Every day we delay transformation, Indigenous territories face appropriation, extractive industries expand their footprint, and wealth concentrates further while communities lose sovereignty over their own resources.

**The Stakes Could Not Be Higher**: Success means Indigenous communities exercise genuine sovereignty over traditional territories, urban communities gain democratic control over essential assets, and workers transition from extraction to regeneration with dignity and community support. It means economies that serve ecosystem health and community well-being within planetary boundaries. Failure means continued appropriation of Indigenous lands, deepening economic apartheid, and ecological systems pushed beyond recovery.

**The Historic Opportunity**: For the first time in generations, converging movements are creating unprecedented momentum for fundamental property transformation. Over 1,700 community land trusts across North America are demonstrating viable alternatives to extractive ownership, while Indigenous-led land trusts like Sogorea Te' and Dishgamu Humboldt are pioneering new models that combine traditional governance with legal recognition. The UN's designation of 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives under the theme "Cooperatives Build a Better World" signals global recognition that cooperative enterprise models are "essential solutions to overcome many global challenges."

## The Movement Moment: Converging Opportunities

**Land Back Acceleration**: The #LandBack movement is "pushing people to grapple with centuries of colonization and repair the harms done to Indigenous communities by returning the land that was stolen from them." Canadian land trusts are actively supporting Indigenous solidarity through land rematriation, with concrete examples like Land in Common returning 184 acres to Bomazeen Land Trust. The Hearthstone Protocol's **Rematriation Legal Protocol** provides the international legal framework to systematize and accelerate these grassroots efforts.

**Cooperative Enterprise Momentum**: Existing models like Evergreen Cooperative's "Fund for Employee Ownership" are already "converting existing businesses into employee-owned enterprises, creating sustainable models of shared prosperity." Worker cooperatives demonstrate "twice the number surviving their first five years compared with other business ownership models (80% vs 44%)," proving economic viability. The framework's **Corporate Co-op Conversion Process** scales these proven approaches with legal clarity and financial incentives.

**Legal Infrastructure Development**: Indigenous leaders are creating new models: "Oregon Land Justice Project works with land trusts across Oregon to educate, build relationships and create organizational change, shifting the model of land trusts and creating space for Indigenous leadership to be front and center," while projects like Dishgamu Humboldt demonstrate "structurally ensuring that the Wiyot tribe will maintain decision-making power in this land trust, forever."

**Cultural Narrative Shift**: Organizations like Resource Generation are facilitating "Land Reparations & Indigenous Solidarity" with concrete examples including individuals transferring "$250K to Ute Tribe in Utah for stolen land" and the Sogorea Tè Land Trust's "Shuumi Land Tax" model where "non-Indigenous people pay into the... tax to acknowledge the history of colonization, land theft and the Ohlone community."

## Immediate Actions: Every Role Matters

### For Individuals
- **Support Land Back Movements**: Pay voluntary land taxes where they exist (like Shuumi Land Tax), learn whose ancestral lands you're on, and complete reflection exercises on territorial acknowledgment. Support Indigenous land trusts by offering "resources, expertise, and time."
- **Join Community Land Trusts**: Research existing CLTs in your area or help establish new ones. Consider specifying in CLT bylaws that "if your CLT dissolved, your assets will be transferred to Indigenous nations or organizations."
- **Advocate for Cooperative Enterprise**: Support worker and housing cooperatives, encourage local businesses to explore cooperative conversion, and advocate for supportive policy frameworks.
- **Practice Stewardship Transition**: Begin the **Stewardship Inheritance Protocol** by connecting with the **Stewardship Mentorship Program** to explore transitioning personal assets to community benefit.

### For Organizations
- **Implement Regenerative Governance**: Transition toward stakeholder governance models through the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework**, adopt **Stewardship-Linked Valuation** metrics, and explore **Corporate Co-op Conversion** pathways.
- **Support Rematriation Initiatives**: Fund Indigenous-led land trusts, implement organizational changes "shifting the model... and creating space for Indigenous leadership to be front and center," and adopt Indigenous solidarity protocols in institutional practices.
- **Deploy Resources for Commons**: Use institutional assets to support community land trusts, provide technical assistance for cooperative conversions, and advocate for supportive legal frameworks at local and regional levels.

### For Governments
- **Legal Framework Development**: Recognize Indigenous territorial rights through **FPIC 2.0** protocols, support commons legal frameworks like **Stewardship Trust** recognition, and fund just transition programs for affected workers.
- **Economic Incentive Alignment**: Implement tax incentives for cooperative conversions and stewardship transitions, support **Commons Conversion Bonds** for institutional investor protection, and fund **Land Rematriation Initiative** through public-private partnerships.
- **International Cooperation**: Join **Commons Sanctuary Protocols** for mutual defense of commons transitions, support **Treaty for Our Only Home** ratification, and establish bilateral agreements facilitating **International Commons Court** jurisdiction.

### For Communities
- **Organize for Community Ownership**: Establish community land trusts following Indigenous-led models, organize for municipal asset transitions through **Urban Commons Transition Protocol**, and build cooperative economic alternatives in essential sectors.
- **Document Traditional Systems**: Work with **Earth Council** representatives to document traditional governance systems and territorial relationships, participate in **Bioregional Readiness Assessment** for potential **BAZ** designation.
- **Build Cooperative Networks**: Connect with the broader cooperative movement during this **UN International Year of Cooperatives**, share successful models through **Commons Governance Pattern Library**, and participate in **Commons Sandbox Zones** for experimental stewardship approaches.

## Strategic Advocacy: Policy and Narrative Change

### Legislative Priorities
- **Stewardship Trust Legal Recognition**: Advocate for state and national legislation recognizing **Stewardship Trusts** as legitimate legal entities with governance rights and tax benefits.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty Protection**: Support implementation of **UNDRIP** principles through domestic legislation, fund Indigenous-led governance institutions, and establish **FPIC 2.0** as standard practice for territorial decisions.
- **Cooperative Conversion Support**: Develop "supportive policies and regulatory frameworks that foster cooperative growth" including conversion incentives, technical assistance funding, and simplified regulatory processes.

### Cultural Narrative Transformation
The **"Story of Stewardship" Initiative** counters extractive narratives with regenerative alternatives:

**From**: "Private property is freedom and security"  
**To**: "Stewardship is prosperity and care for future generations"

**From**: "Commons means no one is responsible"  
**To**: "Commons means everyone is accountable through transparent Love Ledger metrics"

**From**: "This threatens economic stability"  
**To**: "This creates resilient economies that serve community well-being within ecological limits"

### Coalition Building
- **Indigenous-Led Leadership**: Center Indigenous sovereignty and traditional governance as foundation, not consultation
- **Labor Movement Alliance**: Partner with unions on worker cooperative conversion and just transition programs
- **Environmental Justice Integration**: Connect commons transition with climate action and ecosystem protection
- **Faith and Spiritual Communities**: Engage religious traditions emphasizing stewardship and social justice
- **Youth Climate Movement**: Integrate intergenerational equity and **Youth Stewardship Fellowship** opportunities

## Economic Leverage: Capital for Commons

### Investment Redirection
- **Divestment-Investment Strategy**: Redirect capital from extractive industries toward **Regenerative Financial System** vehicles
- **Pension Fund Engagement**: Support **Commons Conversion Bonds** protecting institutional investors while enabling asset transitions
- **Impact Investment Scaling**: Channel impact capital toward **Land Rematriation Initiative** and cooperative conversion funding

### Reparative Finance
- **Corporate Reparations Implementation**: Advocate for **Corporate Reparations Protocol** requiring extractive industries to fund commons transitions
- **Debt-for-Commons Swaps**: Support indebted landowners through **Debt-for-Stewardship Swap** mechanisms
- **Community Controlled Finance**: Establish community investment funds for local asset acquisition and stewardship trust establishment

## Crisis Response: Commons as Resilience

**Climate Crisis Urgency**: As climate impacts accelerate, extractive ownership blocks necessary ecosystem restoration and community resilience. The framework's **Emergency Stewardship Protocol** provides legal mechanisms for rapid commons protection during climate emergencies.

**Economic Instability Response**: During economic crises, **No-Fault Commons Support Protocol** ensures stewarded assets receive emergency support without reverting to extractive ownership, while **Commons Conversion Bonds** provide stability for affected investors.

**Democratic Crisis Protection**: As authoritarianism threatens community rights globally, **Commons Sanctuary Protocols** create mutual defense networks protecting participatory governance and Indigenous sovereignty.

## The Vision Realized: 15-Year Transformation

**Year 3**: Pioneer **Stewardship Trusts** demonstrate economic viability while **Land Rematriation Initiative** returns significant territories to Indigenous governance. **Urban Commons Transition** creates community-controlled housing and infrastructure in multiple cities.

**Year 7**: **Corporate Co-op Conversion** becomes mainstream pathway for business succession while **Commons Dividend Protocol** distributes regenerative value to communities. **International Commons Court** adjudicates cross-border disputes with established precedent.

**Year 15**: Extractive ownership becomes exceptional rather than normal. Indigenous communities exercise sovereignty over traditional territories through legal recognition and institutional support. Urban communities control essential assets through cooperative governance. Workers transition from extraction to regeneration with dignity and community support. Assets serve ecosystem health and community well-being within ecological limits, guided by **Stewardship-Linked Valuation** metrics.

**The Sacred Economics**: Like Corrina Gould of Sogorea Te' explains about the Shuumi Land Tax: "I think that people understand what that word 'tax' means, and I think they are willing to be able to participate in that kind of way." The framework provides the legal and cultural infrastructure to systematize this voluntary participation at scale, creating economic flows that heal rather than extract.

## Your Role in History

Property relations have shaped human civilization for millennia—from feudalism to capitalism to whatever comes next. The **Hearthstone Protocol** provides the bridge from extractive ownership to regenerative stewardship, but implementation requires collective action across all levels of society.

**The Tools Exist**: Legal frameworks for **Stewardship Trusts**, economic mechanisms for **Commons Dividends**, and cultural narratives celebrating stewardship over extraction.

**The Movements Are Ready**: From the 1,700+ community land trusts to the UN International Year of Cooperatives to Indigenous-led land trust innovations, the infrastructure for transformation is emerging.

**The Moment Is Now**: Climate crisis demands rapid ecosystem restoration only possible through commons stewardship. Economic inequality requires cooperative alternatives to corporate extraction. Indigenous sovereignty movements are building legal and cultural momentum for land return.

**Begin Where You Are**: Whether you own assets ready for stewardship transition, work for an organization exploring cooperative conversion, represent government capable of supporting commons law, or live in community organizing for local ownership—your participation in commons transition advances healing for all life.

**The Sacred Trust**: Every asset transitioned from extraction to stewardship, every worker-owned enterprise, every acre returned to Indigenous governance represents sacred trust—holding land, capital, and enterprise as gifts for future generations rather than commodities for accumulation.

**The age of extractive ownership is ending by our collective choice. The era of regenerative stewardship begins with our action.**

**Join the commons transition. Support Indigenous sovereignty. Build cooperative economy. Choose relationship over property.**

**The Earth calls. Future generations await. History watches.**

**What will you choose?**
