## Terminology Notes

**Indigenous vs. Native**: The framework uses "Indigenous" as the preferred term recognizing global Indigenous sovereignty movements while respecting that communities may self-identify using various terms including Native, Aboriginal, First Nations, or specific tribal/nation names.

**Commons vs. Public**: "Commons" emphasizes community stewardship and democratic governance rather than state ownership, distinguishing community-controlled assets from government-administered public property.

**Stewardship vs. Management**: "Stewardship" implies sacred relationship and intergenerational responsibility rather than technical management, reflecting Indigenous concepts of reciprocal relationship with land and resources.

**Rematriation vs. Repatriation**: "Rematriation" emphasizes return to life-giving, maternal principles of care rather than patriarchal concepts of returning to "father land," aligning with feminist and Indigenous critiques of colonial property relations.

**Conversion vs. Transformation**: The framework uses both terms contextually—"conversion" for legal/technical processes (Corporate Co-op Conversion) and "transformation" for broader systemic change reflecting fundamental relationship shifts.
