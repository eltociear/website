## <a id="framework-positioning"></a>Framework Positioning & Tier Structure

> *"Transportation is the center of the world! It is the glue of our daily lives. When it goes well, we don't see it. When it goes wrong, it negatively affects everything else."*  
> — Robin Chase

The Mobility Commons operates as a **Tier 2 Life Support System** within the Global Governance Framework, serving as humanity's circulatory system for regenerative coordination. Like blood vessels connecting organs in a living body, transportation infrastructure connects communities, ecosystems, and economic systems, enabling the flow of people, resources, and relationships essential for planetary health.

### Tier 2 Life Support Functions
As a Life Support System, the Mobility Commons:
- **Enables Physical Coordination**: Provides the infrastructure foundation that allows other GGF frameworks to operate effectively across geographic distances
- **Facilitates Resource Flow**: Ensures equitable movement of people, materials, and energy necessary for regenerative economic systems
- **Connects Ecosystems**: Creates corridors that enhance rather than fragment ecological networks through bioregional integration
- **Strengthens Community Resilience**: Links communities in mutual aid networks that enhance collective capacity for climate adaptation and emergency response

### Integration with Framework Ecosystem
The Mobility Commons interlocks seamlessly with all GGF tiers:
- **Tier 1 Core Operating Systems**: Derives authority from Treaty protocols, coordinates through Meta-Governance systems, and implements Justice frameworks
- **Tier 2 Life Support Systems**: Coordinates with Climate & Energy, Food Systems, and Infrastructure frameworks for integrated regenerative systems
- **Tier 3 Application Frameworks**: Enables Urban Development, Rural Regeneration, and Tourism frameworks through transportation infrastructure
