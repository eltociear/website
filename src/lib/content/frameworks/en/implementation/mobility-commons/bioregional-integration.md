## <a id="indigenous-sovereignty"></a>Indigenous Transportation Sovereignty

> *"Let me be a free man, free to travel, free to stop, free to work, free to trade where I choose my own teachers, free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to think and talk and act for myself, and I will obey every law, or submit to the penalty."*  
> — Chief Joseph, Nez Perce Leader

> *"The traditions of our people are handed down from father to son. The Chief is considered to be the most learned and the leader of the tribe."*  
> — Sarah Winnemucca, Paiute
