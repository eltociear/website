> *"The tragic thing is that we're letting our transportation system crumble at the exact moment we need to build it up."*  
> — Anthony Foxx

> *"Climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans' care, campaign finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on the list of matters that the world's greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing."*  
> — George Packer
