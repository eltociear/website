## <a id="pillars-overview"></a>Pillars Overview

> *"For every $1 billion we invest in public transportation, we create 30,000 jobs, save thousands of dollars a year for each commuter, and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions."*  
> — Bernie Sanders

> *"Our decisions about transportation determine much more than where roads or bridges or tunnels or rail lines will be built. They determine the connections and barriers that people will encounter in their daily lives - and thus how hard or easy it will be for people to get where they need and want to go."*  
> — Elijah Cummings

The Mobility Commons operates through four interconnected pillars that transform transportation from an extractive industry into a regenerative commons. Each pillar addresses a fundamental dimension of the mobility transformation while integrating seamlessly with the others to create a comprehensive system for regenerative transportation.

These pillars embody the wisdom that true transformation requires simultaneous work across governance, infrastructure, economics, and justice—no single intervention can achieve the systemic change needed for regenerative mobility. Together, they create the architecture for transportation systems that serve the flourishing of all beings.
