## <a id="innovation-overview"></a>Mobility Innovation Commons Overview

> *"Urban mobility is a massive global challenge. The world needs people to use multiple forms of transport - a mix of biking, walking, and other low-energy forms of transportation."*  
> — Jens Martin Skibsted

> *"Technological breakthroughs in energy storage will make renewable power cheap enough to use in more places and accelerate the move to electric cars and other electric transportation systems."*  
> — Brian Deese
