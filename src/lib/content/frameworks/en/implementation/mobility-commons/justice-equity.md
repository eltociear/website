## <a id="universal-access-implementation"></a>Universal Access Implementation

> *"We can build wealth in all our communities, value public education, plan for our neighborhoods, invest in housing we can afford and transportation that serves everyone, truly fund public health for safety and healing, and deliver on a city Green New Deal for clean air and water, healthy homes, and the brightest future for our children."*  
> — Michelle Wu

> *"Effective use of Braille is as important to the blind as independent mobility, knowledge in the use of adaptive technology, and the core belief that equality, opportunity and security are truly possible for all people who are blind."*  
> — National Federation of the Blind

Transportation justice begins with the fundamental recognition that mobility is a human right that must be accessible to all people regardless of ability, income, location, or any other characteristic. The Mobility Commons framework embeds universal access as a non-negotiable foundation rather than an afterthought, ensuring that transportation systems serve the full diversity of human experience.
