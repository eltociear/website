## <a id="milestone-overview"></a>Milestone-Based Progression Overview

> *"When there is in nature no fixed condition, how much less must there be in the life of a people, beings endowed with mobility and movement!"*  
> — Jose Rizal

> *"Everywhere I go, I see incredible examples of communities that have a vision for transportation and how it will impact the quality of life, mobility, economics and opportunity."*  
> — Anthony Foxx

The Mobility Commons unfolds through a carefully designed four-phase implementation process that prioritizes Indigenous sovereignty, community ownership, and ecological integration while building toward global transformation. Rather than imposing uniform standards, this approach allows for diverse pathways that honor bioregional differences and cultural sovereignty.

**Milestone-Driven Progression**: Each phase includes specific, measurable milestones that must be achieved before advancing to the next phase, ensuring solid foundations and preventing rushed implementation that could harm communities or ecosystems.

**Adaptive Governance**: Implementation adapts to local conditions, cultural protocols, and emerging challenges through the **Emergent Governance Protocol**, allowing communities to modify approaches while maintaining core principles.

**Justice-Centered Scaling**: Every phase embeds Indigenous sovereignty, disability justice, youth authority, and community ownership as non-negotiable requirements rather than afterthoughts.
