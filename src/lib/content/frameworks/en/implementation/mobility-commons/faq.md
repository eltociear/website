## Common Themes & Core Principles

**Community Sovereignty**: Every aspect of the Mobility Commons prioritizes community authority over transportation decisions affecting their lives and territories.

**Universal Access**: Transportation systems designed for all abilities, ages, and economic circumstances with no one excluded from mobility access.

**Cultural Continuity**: Transportation supporting rather than disrupting traditional practices, Indigenous sovereignty, and intergenerational knowledge transmission.

**Ecological Integration**: Transportation systems healing rather than harming ecosystems through regenerative design and Traditional Ecological Knowledge.

**Economic Justice**: Transportation wealth serving community development rather than corporate extraction through cooperative ownership and **Love Ledger** redistribution.

**Democratic Accountability**: All transportation governance subject to community oversight with transparency, participation, and modification authority.

**Future Generations**: Transportation decisions evaluated through seven-generation thinking with youth authority protecting long-term sustainability.

The Mobility Commons transforms transportation from a source of extraction and exclusion into pathways of connection that serve the flourishing of all beings while honoring Earth's living systems. These frequently asked questions address real concerns while demonstrating that regenerative, equitable, and democratically-controlled transportation is not only possible but essential for our collective thriving.

**The deeper question isn't whether we can afford to transform transportation—it's whether we can afford not to, when the current system drives climate breakdown, deepens inequality, and fragments the relationships that sustain life itself.**

**Join us in creating mobility systems that connect rather than divide, that heal rather than harm, and that serve the freedom of movement as a fundamental right for all beings.**
