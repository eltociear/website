## <a id="appendices-overview"></a>Appendices Overview

### Supporting the Mobility Commons Implementation

These appendices provide detailed implementation guidance, technical specifications, and practical tools for transforming transportation systems through the Mobility Commons framework. Each appendix offers specific protocols, assessment tools, and step-by-step guidance for different aspects of regenerative transportation development.

**Implementation Philosophy**: These appendices embody the understanding that transformative change requires both visionary frameworks and practical tools. They bridge the gap between regenerative transportation principles and on-the-ground implementation, respecting community sovereignty while providing tested methodologies.

**Community-Centered Approach**: All appendices prioritize community ownership of implementation processes, Indigenous sovereignty over traditional territories, and universal access as non-negotiable design principles. They serve as resources for communities rather than prescriptive requirements.

**Adaptive Framework**: These appendices are designed for adaptation to local contexts, cultural values, and bioregional conditions. Communities are encouraged to modify, supplement, and improve these tools based on their specific needs and Traditional Knowledge.

**Integration with GGF Ecosystem**: Each appendix connects seamlessly with broader Global Governance Framework mechanisms, ensuring the Mobility Commons operates as part of comprehensive regenerative governance rather than isolated transportation policy.
