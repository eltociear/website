The Mobility Commons operates through eleven foundational principles that transform transportation from an extractive commodity into a regenerative commons. These principles honor both ancient wisdom about movement and place while embracing emerging possibilities for post-carbon mobility systems that serve all beings.

Each principle integrates seamlessly with the Global Governance Framework, drawing authority from the **Treaty for Our Only Home** while coordinating with specialized frameworks for climate action, Indigenous sovereignty, disability justice, and youth leadership. Together, they create the foundation for transportation systems that heal rather than harm, connect rather than divide, and regenerate rather than extract.

## <a id="mobility-commons"></a>🌍 Mobility as a Commons

**Core Commitment**: The freedom to move is a public good, governed transparently by multi-stakeholder councils, prioritizing community benefit over private gain.

Transportation systems are not commodities to be owned by corporations or controlled by distant bureaucracies, but commons to be stewarded democratically by the communities they serve. This principle transforms mobility from a market-based service into a shared resource governed through participatory decision-making that prioritizes universal access, ecological health, and community sovereignty.

### Implementation Through Democratic Governance
The **Global Mobility Council (GMC)** operates as a multi-stakeholder body with rotating leadership including:
- Representatives from **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)** with decision-making authority over local transport
- Indigenous voices holding veto power over projects affecting traditional territories  
- Youth councils with suspensive veto power over infrastructure with 50+ year lifespans
- Disability advocates ensuring universal access compliance
- Informal transport workers organized through cooperatives and unions
- Technical experts in transportation and energy systems

### Transparency & Accountability Mechanisms
All transportation resource flows, decision-making processes, and impact assessments are published in the **Digital Commons** with real-time public dashboards. Community feedback channels include **Mobility Listening Sessions** and mobile participatory tools, while the **Love Ledger** system enables continuous community input on transportation performance.

### Community Ownership Transitions
Clear protocols support transitioning transport systems from private or state control to cooperative ownership, ensuring regenerative local economies while maintaining service quality and universal access.
