The Sundown Protocol serves as a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework** within the Global Governance Framework ecosystem, seamlessly integrating with constitutional foundations, core operating systems, and complementary applications to ensure comprehensive, coordinated industrial transformation. This integration architecture ensures that harmful industry transitions are managed through proven GGF coordination mechanisms while contributing to the broader regenerative transformation.

## <a id="framework-integration-overview"></a>Framework Integration Overview

**Integration Philosophy**: The Sundown Protocol operates as a specialized application of broader GGF principles, translating abstract concepts of justice, regeneration, and democratic participation into concrete mechanisms for industrial transition. Rather than operating independently, it leverages existing GGF infrastructure while contributing its expertise in managed decommissioning, community-centered planning, and ecological restoration.

**Core Integration Functions**:
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Derives legal authority from **Treaty for Our Only Home** and operates within **Global Enforcement Mechanism** jurisdiction
- **Operating System Utilization**: Employs **Justice OS**, **Economic OS**, **Governance OS**, and **Ecological OS** capabilities for comprehensive transition management
- **Application Coordination**: Complements **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** by providing exit pathways for non-certifiable industries
- **Enforcement Integration**: Connects with **Shield Protocol** and **Digital Justice Tribunal** for compliance assurance

**Unique GGF Contribution**: The Sundown Protocol provides the GGF ecosystem with proven methodologies for compassionate industrial transformation, comprehensive worker protection, and systematic ecological restoration that other frameworks can adapt for their own transition needs.

## <a id="constitutional-foundation"></a>Constitutional Foundation

### Treaty for Our Only Home Authority

**Legal Mandate**: The **Treaty for Our Only Home** provides constitutional authority for mandatory industry transitions through its planetary health protection and intergenerational justice provisions. Article [X] specifically authorizes systematic transition of industries identified as existentially harmful by **Planetary Health Council** assessment.

**Enforcement Mechanism**: The **Global Enforcement Mechanism (GEM)** provides legal backstop for Sundown Protocol implementation, including:
- **Jurisdiction over Multinationals**: Authority over corporate entities in signatory nations, preventing relocation of harmful activities
- **Asset Seizure Powers**: Capability to freeze non-compliant corporate assets in GGF-integrated financial systems
- **Trade Sanction Authority**: Coordination with **Shield Protocol** for export bans and market exclusions

**Constitutional Safeguards**: Treaty provisions ensure democratic participation, Indigenous sovereignty, and youth authority are maintained throughout transition processes, with built-in appeals and oversight mechanisms.

### Reformed UN Security Council Coordination

**International Legitimacy**: The **Reformed UN Security Council** provides international diplomatic framework for coordinating transition policies across GGF and non-GGF nations, including:
- **Transition Solidarity Compacts**: Bilateral agreements for sharing expertise and technology
- **Carbon Leakage Prevention**: Coordinated policies preventing harmful industry relocation
- **Diplomatic Protection**: Security guarantees for nations implementing transition policies
