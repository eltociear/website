# The Sundown Protocol: At-a-Glance
**A Just Transition Framework for Retiring Harmful Industries**

---

## **What Is It?**
The Sundown Protocol is a comprehensive framework for the managed, compassionate retirement of industries identified as harmful to planetary health—transforming their ending into regenerative opportunities for workers, communities, and ecosystems.

**Core Premise**: Instead of letting harmful industries collapse chaotically, we guide them through an honorable "graduation" into regenerative alternatives while protecting everyone affected.

---

## **Key Vision**
By 2040, envision:
- Former coal miners leading geothermal installations
- Oil refineries transformed into biofuel cooperatives  
- Industrial agriculture regions flourishing as regenerative food forests
- Extraction sites reborn as carbon sinks and biodiversity havens

## **The Call to Action**

*"Every ending is a beginning in disguise. The same factories that once burned coal can forge solar panels. The same hands that extracted oil can plant forests. The same communities that powered yesterday's economy can architect tomorrow's regeneration."*

**The age of extraction is ending. The era of regeneration begins now.**

**Join us in transforming humanity's greatest challenge—retiring harmful industries—into our greatest opportunity for justice, healing, and regenerative abundance.**
