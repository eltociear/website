The Sundown Protocol recognizes that retiring extractive industries requires more than economic transition—it demands comprehensive healing of historical harms, restoration of dignity, and transformation of relationships between humans, communities, and the living earth. Justice, reparations, and healing form the moral foundation upon which all other protocol activities rest.

## <a id="justice-framework"></a>Justice Framework: From Extraction to Restoration

### <a id="transformative-justice-philosophy"></a>Transformative Justice Philosophy

**Beyond Punishment to Healing**: The protocol embraces transformative justice principles that focus on healing harm rather than punishing wrongdoing. Rather than vilifying industries or workers, the framework creates pathways for acknowledging harm, making amends, and building regenerative relationships.

**Restorative Relationships**: Justice means repairing relationships between extractive industries and affected communities, between humans and damaged ecosystems, and between current actions and future generations. The goal is not retribution but restoration of right relationship.

**Systemic Transformation**: Individual accountability occurs within systemic change—recognizing that extractive harm emerges from systems that reward ecological destruction. Justice requires changing these systems while supporting individuals and communities in healing and transformation.

**Community-Defined Justice**: Affected communities define what justice means for their specific contexts, drawing on Indigenous justice principles, local cultural traditions, and collaborative dialogue to determine appropriate responses to harm.

- **Economic Exploitation**: Recognition of wealth extraction from communities while leaving environmental and health costs behind

- **Gender & Intersectional Impact**: Assessment of differential impacts on women, LGBTQ+ communities, and other marginalized groups
- **Democratic Harm**: Recognition of corporate political influence undermining democratic decision-making about community futures

### <a id="justice-principles"></a>Core Justice Principles

**Those Most Harmed Lead**: Communities and workers most affected by extractive industries hold primary authority over defining justice and leading healing processes. External support serves community-defined priorities rather than imposing solutions.

**Collective and Individual Accountability**: Both corporate entities and individual leaders bear responsibility for harm while recognizing systemic factors that shaped their choices. Accountability includes making amends and supporting transformation.

**Healing-Centered Approach**: Justice processes prioritize healing trauma, rebuilding relationships, and creating conditions for community and ecosystem flourishing rather than focusing primarily on punishment or blame.

**Interconnected Restoration**: Healing human communities and healing damaged ecosystems are understood as interconnected processes requiring simultaneous attention to social and ecological restoration.

**Future-Focused Transformation**: Justice includes preventing future harm through systematic change while addressing past and present harm through reparations and healing.

The Justice, Reparations & Healing framework transforms the Sundown Protocol from an economic transition into a comprehensive healing process that addresses historical harms while building regenerative futures. Through comprehensive worker protection, community reparations, Indigenous-led oversight, and deep cultural healing processes, the protocol ensures that industrial transition becomes an opportunity for justice and restoration rather than additional trauma.

This framework recognizes that retiring extractive industries requires more than economic change—it demands healing relationships between humans and the living earth, between communities and economic systems, and between current actions and future generations. Through ceremonial closure, cultural preservation, truth-telling, and community-controlled innovation, the protocol transforms endings into beginnings and harm into healing.

The integration with broader GGF justice systems ensures that transition justice is not isolated but connected to global systems of accountability, protection, and democratic participation. Together, these elements create a comprehensive approach to justice that honors the past, heals the present, and builds regenerative futures for all generations.
