The Sundown Protocol succeeds through comprehensive stakeholder integration that transforms potential opposition into collaborative partnership while ensuring affected communities maintain agency and control over their transition processes. Rather than imposing transitions from above, the framework creates structured engagement pathways that honor diverse interests while maintaining commitment to ecological integrity and social justice.

## <a id="comprehensive-stakeholder-architecture"></a>Comprehensive Stakeholder Architecture
