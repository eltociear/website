## <a id="cycle-overview"></a>Cycle Overview

The Crisis-to-Recovery Cycle represents the fundamental transformation of how communities relate to disasters—from external emergencies that disrupt normal life to learning opportunities that deepen community resilience and strengthen relationships with place. Rather than treating disasters as isolated events requiring reactive response, the cycle embeds preparedness in daily life and recovery in regenerative opportunity.

**The Revolutionary Shift:**
Traditional disaster management operates through a linear sequence: disaster strikes, emergency response activates, recovery restores "normal," and everyone forgets until the next disaster. This creates amnesia cycles where communities repeatedly experience the same vulnerabilities without building genuine adaptive capacity.

The Crisis-to-Recovery Cycle breaks this pattern by creating continuous learning loops where each phase informs and strengthens all others. Communities practicing this cycle don't just survive disasters—they use environmental challenges as opportunities to deepen community bonds, strengthen ecological relationships, and develop collective wisdom.

**Five Transformational Phases:**
- **Pre-Disaster**: Resilience embedded in daily community life rather than emergency preparation
- **During Crisis**: Community networks activating seamlessly because they've been practiced for years  
- **Immediate Recovery**: Holistic assessment and response addressing trauma, relationships, and immediate needs
- **Long-Term Reconstruction**: Regenerative rebuilding that improves long-term resilience rather than just restoring infrastructure
- **System Learning**: Wisdom integration that strengthens future preparedness and adaptive capacity

**Community Agency Throughout:**
Unlike traditional cycles that create dependency on external assistance, this cycle maintains community decision-making authority during every phase while coordinating with broader support networks.

**Cultural Integration Principle:**
Each phase operates through Indigenous governance systems, traditional knowledge, and cultural practices rather than imposing external emergency management procedures.

**The Meta-Goal:**
Communities practicing the complete cycle report that disasters become opportunities for community strengthening rather than just survival challenges, demonstrating a fundamental shift in relationship with uncertainty.
