**Tier**: 2 (Planetary Health & Resilience)  
**Status**: Revision 4.2 - GGF-Integrated, Indigenous-Guided  
**Estimated Reading Time**: 18 minutes

**Framework Development**: The DRR&R Framework transforms humanity's approach to disasters from reactive emergency response to proactive resilience weaving, integrating Indigenous wisdom, ecological intelligence, and community-centered governance to build adaptive capacity for our climate-changed future.

## [Introduction & Planetary Context: Weaving Resilience in the Climate Era](/frameworks/disaster-risk-reduction#introduction-context)

**The Challenge**: Annual disaster losses now exceed $202 billion globally and are projected to rise exponentially as climate breakdown accelerates. Traditional disaster management focuses on rebuilding the same vulnerable systems, trapping communities in cycles of destruction and dependence.

**The Opportunity**: For the first time, we can weave resilience directly into community fabric through the Global Governance Framework ecosystem—connecting **Community Weavers** who understand local vulnerabilities with **Ecological Intelligence** that predicts cascading failures, backed by **AUBI** systems that surge support when disasters strike.

**The Vision**: By 2035, picture communities so deeply resilient that floods become opportunities to restore wetlands, hurricanes trigger pre-positioned mutual aid networks, and "disasters" become learning cycles that strengthen rather than devastate local ecosystems and social bonds.

**Real-World Grounding**: Building on proven transformations like Bangladesh's women-led cyclone early warning systems (reducing deaths by 98%), Japan's community-based tsunami preparedness, and Indigenous fire management that prevents catastrophic blazes while regenerating landscapes.
