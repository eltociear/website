# Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework: At a Glance

## **The Big Picture**
Transform disaster vulnerability into community resilience by weaving preparedness into daily life, making prevention profitable, and ensuring communities control their own recovery—moving from external dependency to community agency.

---

## **🎯 Core Vision**
**From**: Reactive emergency response → disaster capitalism → repeated destruction  
**To**: Proactive resilience weaving → community ownership → regenerative recovery

Communities so deeply resilient that disasters become opportunities for learning and regeneration rather than cycles of destruction and dependency.

## **🌱 Six Guiding Principles**

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **🌱 Ethical Governance** | Compassionate protection for all life, prioritizing mental health, disability inclusion, and traditional wisdom |
| **🤝 Co-Creation** | Indigenous-led design through Community Weavers and BAZ-level councils |
| **⚖️ Equity & Inclusivity** | Gender-responsive, disability-inclusive approaches addressing Global North-South imbalances |
| **🌍 Interconnected Systems** | Links disaster resilience to climate adaptation, ecosystem health, and mental wellness |
| **🔄 Adaptive Learning** | Iterative improvement through real-time feedback and traditional knowledge |
| **🛡️ Planetary Duty of Care** | Legal responsibility to proactively protect communities from predictable disasters |

## **🔄 Transformed Disaster Cycle**

| Traditional Cycle | Transformed Cycle |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Pre-Disaster**: Emergency planning | **Pre-Disaster**: Resilience as daily practice |
| **During Crisis**: External rescue | **During Crisis**: Community networks activate |
| **Recovery**: Restore "normal" | **Recovery**: Build back better with community power |
| **Forget**: Until next disaster | **Learn**: Integrate wisdom for future resilience |

---

## **📊 Community Resilience Score (CRS)**
