## <a id="integration-overview"></a>Integration Overview

The Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Integration component recognizes that Indigenous peoples have maintained resilient societies for millennia through sophisticated governance systems, ecological knowledge, and cultural practices that provide the foundation for genuine community resilience. Rather than treating Traditional Ecological Knowledge as supplementary information, this integration centers Indigenous wisdom as foundational to all disaster resilience work.

**The Paradigm Shift:**
Traditional disaster management treats Indigenous knowledge as interesting cultural information that might supplement scientific analysis. The DRR&R Framework recognizes that Indigenous knowledge systems often provide more sophisticated understanding of local climate patterns, ecosystem relationships, and community resilience than contemporary science, requiring genuine partnership rather than extractive consultation.

**Sovereignty, Not Consultation:**
This integration moves beyond consultation requirements to recognition of Indigenous governance authority, traditional territory sovereignty, and cultural intellectual property rights. Indigenous communities receive veto power over resilience initiatives affecting their territories and governing authority over how their knowledge is used and shared.

**Four Pillars of Integration:**
- **Governance Authority**: Indigenous self-determination over resilience initiatives in traditional territories
- **Knowledge Systems**: Traditional Ecological Knowledge as equal to scientific analysis in disaster risk assessment
- **Cultural Protocols**: Ceremonial practices and spiritual relationships as essential resilience infrastructure
- **Economic Justice**: Indigenous communities receiving direct benefits from traditional knowledge applications

**Connection to Global Governance Framework:**
Indigenous integration operates through the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** while connecting to **Treaty for Our Only Home** sovereignty provisions, **Digital Justice Tribunal** cultural intellectual property protection, and **AUBI Framework** economic recognition for traditional knowledge holders.

**The Meta-Principle:**
All aspects of DRR&R implementation must strengthen rather than undermine Indigenous sovereignty, traditional governance systems, and cultural relationships that provide the foundation for Indigenous community resilience.
