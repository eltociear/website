### B.7: Framework Design Implications

These case studies inform key DRR&R Framework design decisions:

**Community Weavers Model**: Proven effectiveness of trained local leaders integrating traditional knowledge with modern approaches.

**BAZ-Level Implementation**: Community-scale governance enables cultural adaptation while maintaining coordination across larger areas.

**Multi-Framework Integration**: Disaster resilience requires coordination across peace, economic, governance, and environmental frameworks.

**Cultural Adaptation Requirements**: Framework must be flexible enough to adapt to diverse cultural contexts while maintaining core effectiveness.

**Technology Sovereignty**: Communities must control their data and technology systems while benefiting from broader coordination.

**Economic Sustainability**: Resilience building must create economic value and opportunities for community members.

**Gender and Youth Leadership**: Framework design must ensure meaningful authority for women and young people, not just consultation.

**Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Indigenous and traditional wisdom must have equal authority with scientific knowledge in decision-making.

These case studies demonstrate that effective disaster resilience emerges from community-led approaches that integrate cultural wisdom with appropriate technology, supported by broader governance and economic systems that enable rather than undermine local capacity.
