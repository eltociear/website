# Kinship Protocol: At a Glance

## **What It Is**
The **Kinship Protocol** is a comprehensive Tier 3 framework within the Global Governance Framework that embeds gender and LGBTQ+ justice as a non-negotiable layer across all global governance systems. It transforms institutions from spaces of exclusion into engines of liberation, ensuring people of all genders and sexual orientations have institutionalized power in shaping our collective future.

## **Core Vision**
**By 2050**: A world with zero gender-based discrimination, full legal recognition of all identities, and equitable economic inclusion—where trans climate scientists lead adaptation planning, nonbinary engineers design space habitats, and Indigenous Two-Spirit elders guide planetary stewardship.

## **The Four Pillars**

| **Pillar** | **Focus** | **Key Components** | **2030 Targets** |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **🏛️ Foundational Governance** | Democratic power-sharing | Gender & Kinship Justice Council with veto power over discriminatory policies | Council operational in 50+ countries |
| **⚖️ Legal Transformation** | Rights & recognition | Decriminalization, anti-discrimination laws, legal gender recognition | 80% global decriminalization |
| **💰 Economic Liberation** | Structural equity | AUBI Hearts funding, pay equity, cooperative development | 50% gender pay gap closure |
| **🎭 Cultural Revolution** | Hearts & minds change | Education reform, creative engagement, community dialogue | Kinship Festival in 100+ cities |
