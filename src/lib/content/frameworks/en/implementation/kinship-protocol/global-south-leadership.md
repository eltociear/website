The Global South has consistently led innovation in gender and LGBTQ+ justice, from Argentina's groundbreaking gender identity law to Rwanda's world-leading women's political representation to India's legal recognition of Hijra communities. The Kinship Protocol recognizes this leadership and creates systems that amplify and support Global South wisdom rather than imposing external solutions.

## <a id="leadership-philosophy"></a>Leadership Philosophy

**Learning from Those Leading the Way**

The Global South doesn't need to "catch up" to the Global North on gender and LGBTQ+ issues—in many cases, the Global South is leading the way with more innovative, holistic, and culturally grounded approaches to inclusion and justice.

**Decolonizing Gender Justice**:

**Beyond Western Liberal Models**: Many Global South approaches to gender and sexuality integrate community, spirituality, and collective well-being in ways that transcend Western individualistic rights frameworks. The framework learns from and supports these approaches rather than imposing uniform models.

**Historical Context Recognition**: Understanding that colonialism imposed binary gender systems and heteronormativity on many cultures that previously recognized gender and sexual diversity. Contemporary Global South gender justice movements often involve reclaiming traditional knowledge that was suppressed through colonization.

**Economic Justice Centrality**: Global South movements understand that gender and LGBTQ+ liberation requires addressing poverty, debt, and economic exploitation. Their approaches inherently integrate economic justice in ways that Global North movements are still learning.

**Community-Centered Approaches**: Global South traditions of collective decision-making, extended family structures, and community responsibility inform more holistic approaches to supporting LGBTQ+ people and women that go beyond individual rights to community transformation.

**Core Principles of Global South Leadership**:

**Southern Solutions to Global Problems**: Recognizing that innovations developed in Global South contexts often work better globally than solutions developed in Northern contexts that are then imposed elsewhere.

**Resource Flows**: Ensuring that resources flow to support Global South-led initiatives rather than being controlled by Northern organizations that "work on" Global South issues.

**Knowledge Production**: Supporting Global South communities in documenting, theorizing, and sharing their own innovations rather than having Northern academics study and publish about them.

**Movement Building**: Connecting Global South movements with each other for mutual support and learning rather than routing all connections through Northern hubs.

**International Influence**: Amplifying Global South voices in international policy-making rather than having Northern organizations speak for Global South communities.
