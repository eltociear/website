### Tier 3: Equity & Culture Framework

The Regenerative Journeys Framework operates as a **Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework** within the Global Governance Framework's strategic hierarchy. This positioning reflects tourism's role in cultural preservation, social equity, and community flourishing rather than core planetary survival systems.

**Strategic Hierarchy Context**:
- **Tier 0 (Constitutional)**: **Treaty for Our Only Home** provides ultimate legal authority
- **Tier 1 (Core OS)**: Foundational systems that enable all other frameworks
- **Tier 2 (Applications)**: Essential life-support and capability systems
- **Tier 3 (Equity & Culture)**: Deep equity, inclusion, and cultural preservation systems ← *Regenerative Journeys*
- **Tier 4 (Visionary)**: Long-term governance evolution and meta-frameworks

### Framework Dependencies & Enablement

**Core Dependencies** (Must exist for tourism framework to function):
- **Mobility Commons** (Tier 2): Transportation infrastructure foundation
- **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2): Ecological boundary standards
- **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1): Economic tools for Guest Hearts system
- **Indigenous Framework** (Tier 1): Cultural authority and FPIC 2.0 protocols
- **Aurora Accord** (Tier 1): Data sovereignty and digital protections

**Framework Enablement** (Tourism framework creates these institutions):
- **BAZ Tourism Councils**: Local governance bodies
- **Regenerative Tourism Assembly**: Global coordination council
- **Dynamic Tourism Levy**: Economic mechanism funding Global Commons Fund
- **Tourism Impact Assessments**: Accountability and measurement processes
