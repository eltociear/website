## <a id="right-to-say-no"></a>The Right to Say No

### Community Sovereignty Over Tourism

The Regenerative Journeys Framework is founded on an absolute principle: **communities retain the unconditional right to limit, modify, or completely withdraw from tourism at any time, for any reason, without justification to external parties.**

This is not a policy concession or stakeholder accommodation—it is recognition of fundamental sovereignty. Communities are not tourism destinations; they are places where people live, love, work, and maintain relationships with ancestors and future generations.

### Beyond the Right to Participate

Most tourism governance frameworks focus on the "right to participate" in tourism development. The Regenerative Journeys Framework goes further, explicitly protecting and supporting the **right to withdraw**, the **right to pause**, and the **right to say "no more."**

**Tourism as Relationship, Not Right**: External actors have no inherent right to visit any community. Tourism is always a privilege granted by hosts and can be revoked when hosts determine it no longer serves their flourishing.

**Exit Rights Without Penalty**: Communities exercising withdrawal rights receive full support for economic transition and healing, without punishment, blame, or abandonment by the broader regenerative tourism network.

**Future Re-engagement Authority**: Communities that withdraw maintain complete authority over whether, when, and how they might choose to re-engage with tourism in the future.

### Sacred Economics of Exit

The framework treats community withdrawal as an investment in community wellbeing rather than a loss of tourism opportunity:

**Exit Investment**: Communities exercising withdrawal rights receive enhanced funding for economic diversification and cultural strengthening
**Network Support**: Other BAZ Tourism Councils provide mutual aid and solidarity to withdrawing communities
**Learning Integration**: Withdrawal experiences inform framework improvements and prevent similar problems in other communities
**Success Redefinition**: Community satisfaction and wellbeing are prioritized over tourism revenue retention
