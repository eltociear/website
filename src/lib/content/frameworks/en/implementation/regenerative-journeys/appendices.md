**1. Overtourism Crisis Transformation**

*Case Study: Venice Lagoon Regeneration (Hypothetical Scenario)*

**Community Context:**
Venice faced 25 million annual visitors overwhelming 50,000 permanent residents, leading to housing displacement, environmental degradation, and cultural commodification.

**Transformation Approach:**
- **BAZ Tourism Council Formation**: Residents, workers, youth, and elders formed tourism council with binding authority over tourism decisions
- **Dynamic Visitor Caps**: Real-time visitor limits (5,000-15,000 daily) based on flood data, infrastructure capacity, and resident wellbeing
- **Economic Justice Implementation**: 70% local ownership requirements with cooperative development support
- **Lagoon Restoration**: Tourism levy funded mangrove restoration and traditional fishing technique revival

**Key Innovations:**

- **Economic Justice**: Local revenue retention increased from 25% to 72% with 45 businesses transitioning to cooperatives

**Community Lessons Learned:**
*"The most important lesson was that we had to take control immediately - gradual change just meant more years of suffering while tourism operators found ways around our requirements."* - Maria, Venice Tourism Council Member

*"Youth leadership was essential. The young people understood both the technology and the traditional culture, and they could bridge between grandparents and tourists."* - Giuseppe, Elder Council Representative

*"The tide democracy system taught us that we could make tourism work with nature instead of against it. When the water comes, the tourists learn to respect the lagoon too."* - Isabella, Ecological Restoration Coordinator

**2. Post-Industrial Tourism Renaissance**

*Case Study: Detroit Climate Hub Network (Hypothetical Scenario)*

**Community Context:**
Detroit represented post-industrial economic collapse with 70% population loss since 1950, extensive abandoned infrastructure, and limited economic opportunities.

**Transformation Approach:**

**Community Lessons Learned:**
*"We had to heal from industrial trauma before we could welcome visitors. The healing work was the foundation for everything else."* - Jerome, Community Healing Coordinator

*"The climate migrants brought skills and knowledge we needed. Tourism gave us infrastructure to welcome them with dignity instead of charity."* - Angela, Climate Integration Specialist

*"Cooperative ownership wasn't just about economics - it was about healing from being used by corporations. When we owned our own work, we could welcome visitors as equals."* - Marcus, Cooperative Development Leader

**3. Indigenous-Led Sacred Site Protection**
