## <a id="vision-regenerative-economics"></a>Vision for Regenerative Tourism Economics

### Beyond Extractive to Regenerative Economics

**Current Reality**: In conventional tourism, 60-90% of revenue leaves local communities through foreign-owned hotels, international tour operators, imported goods, and profit repatriation. Communities that host millions of visitors often see minimal economic benefit while bearing the costs of infrastructure strain, environmental degradation, and cultural disruption.

**Regenerative Vision**: Tourism economics designed to circulate wealth within communities, build local ownership, and ensure the land and people who create tourism's value receive the greatest benefit. Every tourist dollar becomes a seed for community prosperity, ecological restoration, and cultural renaissance.

**Sacred Economics Principles**: 
- **Wealth as Relationship**: Economic value emerges from relationship and care rather than extraction and accumulation
- **Circulatory Health**: Economic well-being measured by how wealth flows through community rather than how much accumulates at the top
- **Seven-Generation Prosperity**: Economic decisions evaluated for their impact on seven generations of descendants
- **Land-Based Economics**: Economic systems rooted in the health and regenerative capacity of specific places

### Transformation Indicators

**From Extraction to Circulation**:
- **Before**: Tourism profits flow to distant shareholders and corporate headquarters
- **After**: 80% of tourism revenue circulates within local communities through local ownership and procurement
- **Mechanism**: Local ownership requirements, wealth concentration limits, and corporate accountability bonds

**From Employment to Ownership**:
- **Before**: Community members work in service roles for tourism businesses owned by others
- **After**: Community members own tourism enterprises through cooperatives and community-controlled development
- **Mechanism**: Cooperative development support, community ownership transition programs, and economic democracy

**From Gentrification to Community Benefit**:
- **Before**: Tourism development displaces residents through rising rents and changing neighborhood character
- **After**: Tourism infrastructure serves community needs and residents benefit from tourism amenities
- **Mechanism**: Housing protection funds, community priority systems, and anti-gentrification protocols
