# Stakeholder Engagement: Inclusive Transformation

> *"Indigenous peoples are right on the frontline of the very real and dangerous fight for the world's forests. As Indigenous Peoples, we want to take part in the decision making process in a way that our voice is included or heard within the decision making process, that our Indigenous perspectives, our Indigenous knowledge be included in those processes... that our right to self-determination is part of this whole process."*
