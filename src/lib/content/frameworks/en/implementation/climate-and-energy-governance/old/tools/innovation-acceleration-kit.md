## Climate Innovation Acceleration Kit

### 1. Innovation Landscape Assessment
Evaluate the current state of climate innovations, technological needs, and institutional capacity.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Existing Innovations** | E.g., 1 GW solar microgrid tech, pilot carbon capture systems, climate-smart agriculture tools |
| **Technological Needs** | E.g., Grid-scale energy storage, affordable green hydrogen, drought-resistant crops |
| **Institutional Capacity** | E.g., 5 national research labs, 10 private tech firms, limited startup funding |
| **Current Policies** | E.g., R&D grants ($50M/year), clean tech tax incentives |
| **Stakeholder Ecosystem** | E.g., Universities, startups, CSOs, indigenous knowledge holders |
| **Gaps and Opportunities** | E.g., Limited funding for green hydrogen, opportunity for regional tech hubs |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (clean tech deployment below 2030 target) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use national innovation reports, patent databases, or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for data.
- Identify gaps (e.g., underfunded technologies) and opportunities (e.g., public-private partnerships).
- Assess alignment with Framework goals (e.g., scale clean tech by 2030).

**Example**: Country X has 1 GW of solar microgrid tech but lacks grid-scale storage. R&D grants exist, but funding for green hydrogen is limited, falling short of the Framework’s 2030 clean tech scaling target.

| E.g., Green Hydrogen | Industry, transport | Decarbonize heavy industry, reduce emissions | High |
| E.g., Climate-Smart Agriculture | Agriculture | Enhance food security, sequester carbon | Medium |
| E.g., Urban Cooling Tech | Urban areas | Mitigate heatwaves, improve resilience | Medium |

**Instructions**: 
- List potential innovations, detailing their benefits (e.g., emissions reduction, resilience, social impact).
- Assign priorities based on Framework targets (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035) and equity (e.g., benefits for vulnerable communities).
- Validate priorities with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy), ensuring inclusion of indigenous and local knowledge.
