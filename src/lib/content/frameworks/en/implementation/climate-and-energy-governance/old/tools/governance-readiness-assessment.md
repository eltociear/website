# Governance Readiness Assessment Tool

## Introduction

The **Governance Readiness Assessment Tool** is a core component of the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to help stakeholders evaluate their capacity to implement effective climate and energy governance. This tool enables policymakers, regional authorities, national implementation units, and other governance actors to assess their institutional, policy, and technical readiness to align with the Framework’s goals: achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, universal clean energy access, and climate resilience for vulnerable communities.

The tool assesses readiness across five key dimensions:
1. **Governance Structures**: Institutional frameworks for multi-level coordination.
2. **Policy Mechanisms**: Availability and effectiveness of climate and energy policies.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Inclusion of businesses, civil society, and communities.
4. **Technical Capacity**: Resources and expertise for implementation and monitoring.
5. **Financial Preparedness**: Access to and allocation of climate finance.

By completing this assessment, stakeholders can identify strengths, pinpoint gaps, and prioritize actions to align with the Framework’s principles (sustainability, equity, science-based decision-making, cooperation, adaptability, ethical governance) and implementation roadmap.

### Objectives
- Evaluate readiness to implement the Framework’s governance structures and mechanisms.
- Identify barriers to effective climate and energy governance.
- Provide actionable recommendations to enhance capacity and alignment.
- Support strategic planning for short-term (2025-2030) and medium-term (2030-2040) goals.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- Climate and energy officials
- Regional Climate & Energy Governance Hubs
- National Implementation Units
- Local government authorities

## Instructions

1. **Complete the Assessment**:
   - Review each dimension and its associated criteria.
   - Score your organization’s readiness on a scale of 1–5 for each criterion (see scoring guide below).
   - Provide brief justifications for your scores to contextualize your assessment.

2. **Calculate Scores**:
   - Sum the scores for each dimension to get a subtotal.
   - Calculate the overall readiness score (out of 100) to gauge your organization’s capacity.

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Use the scoring interpretation guide to understand your readiness level.
   - Review recommendations tailored to your score range.

4. **Develop an Action Plan**:
   - Prioritize actions based on identified gaps.
   - Integrate recommendations into your climate and energy governance strategy.

5. **Engage Support**:
   - Contact your Regional Climate & Energy Governance Hub or email [support@climate-energy-framework.org](mailto:support@climate-energy-framework.org) for technical assistance.
   - Access additional tools (e.g., Just Transition Planning Template, Climate Policy Integration Matrix) at [climate-energy-framework.org/tools](https://climate-energy-framework.org/tools).

### Scoring Guide

- **2 (Emerging)**: Initial efforts underway but incomplete or informal.
- **3 (Developing)**: Structures and policies exist but lack full implementation or effectiveness.
- **4 (Advanced)**: Robust systems in place, partially aligned with Framework goals.
- **5 (Optimized)**: Fully aligned with Framework, with scalable, effective systems.
