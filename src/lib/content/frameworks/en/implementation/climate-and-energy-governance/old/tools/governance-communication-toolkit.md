# Governance Communication Toolkit

## Introduction

The **Governance Communication Toolkit** is a vital tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to empower stakeholders to communicate climate and energy governance strategies, policies, and progress effectively to diverse audiences. This toolkit supports policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and other actors in fostering transparency, building trust, and mobilizing support for the Framework’s goals, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035.

The toolkit integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, transparency, cooperation, and science-based decision-making, addressing all four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology. It provides a suite of communication tools—messaging frameworks, presentation templates, social media guides, and community outreach strategies—to ensure clear, inclusive, and impactful messaging across governance levels and sectors.

### Objectives
- Develop clear, evidence-based messaging to communicate climate and energy governance strategies.
- Engage diverse audiences, including vulnerable communities, with inclusive and accessible communication.
- Build trust and support for Framework-aligned policies through transparent reporting.
- Evaluate communication effectiveness to refine strategies and maximize impact.
- Foster coordination across governance levels to amplify communication efforts.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Communication and public relations teams
- CSOs advocating for climate action and equity
- Businesses aligning with climate governance
- General public, including vulnerable and indigenous communities

## Governance Communication Toolkit

### 1. Communication Needs Assessment
Evaluate your audience, goals, and existing communication channels to inform strategy development.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Target Audience** | E.g., Policymakers, rural communities, indigenous groups, businesses |
| **Communication Goals** | E.g., Raise awareness of carbon pricing policy, build support for renewable energy transition |
| **Key Messages** | E.g., Carbon tax reduces emissions by 50% by 2035; renewables create 5,000 jobs |
| **Existing Channels** | E.g., Government website, social media (X, local platforms), community radio |
| **Equity Considerations** | E.g., Translate materials into 3 local languages, ensure accessibility for low-literacy groups |
| **Gaps and Opportunities** | E.g., Limited social media reach, opportunity for community workshops |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Supports transparency and equity principles; aligns with [Climate Policy Brief Templates](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) |

**Instructions**: 
- Identify audiences and tailor goals to Framework targets (e.g., 50% emissions reduction by 2035).
- Assess gaps in current channels and opportunities for inclusive outreach.
- Use the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to ensure diverse representation.

**Example**: Country X targets policymakers and rural communities to promote a carbon tax. Current channels include a website and X, but lack local language content. Opportunities include community radio and workshops to align with Framework’s equity goals.
