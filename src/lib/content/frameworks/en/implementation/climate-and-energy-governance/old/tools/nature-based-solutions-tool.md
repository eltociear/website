# Nature-based Solutions Assessment Tool

## Introduction

The **Nature-based Solutions Assessment Tool** is a key tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to guide stakeholders in evaluating, planning, and implementing nature-based solutions (NbS) to address climate change impacts, enhance resilience, and promote sustainable development. NbS, such as reforestation, wetland restoration, and urban green spaces, leverage ecosystems to deliver climate benefits while supporting biodiversity and community well-being. This tool supports policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and communities in integrating NbS into climate and energy strategies, aligning with the Framework’s goals of protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and enhancing ecosystem health.

The tool integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, sustainability, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, with a focus on the Climate Adaptation and Climate Mitigation pillars. It provides a structured approach to assess NbS potential, prioritize projects, engage stakeholders, and monitor outcomes, ensuring that solutions are inclusive, effective, and aligned with local and global needs.

### Objectives
- Assess the potential of NbS to address climate risks and support Framework goals.
- Prioritize NbS projects based on climate, biodiversity, and community benefits.
- Design and implement NbS with stakeholder input to ensure equity and inclusion.
- Monitor and evaluate NbS outcomes using standardized metrics.
- Foster coordination across governance levels and sectors for scalable NbS deployment.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Environmental and disaster management agencies
- CSOs advocating for climate resilience and biodiversity
- Indigenous and local communities
- Businesses investing in sustainable land use and green infrastructure

## Nature-based Solutions Assessment Tool

### 1. NbS Potential Assessment
Evaluate climate risks, ecosystems, and community needs to identify opportunities for NbS.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Climate Risks** | E.g., Coastal flooding, drought, heatwaves |
| **Ecosystems Available** | E.g., Mangroves, forests, wetlands, urban green spaces |
| **Vulnerable Populations** | E.g., 200,000 coastal residents, 50,000 smallholder farmers |
| **Potential NbS** | E.g., Mangrove restoration, agroforestry, urban tree planting |
| **Current NbS Initiatives** | E.g., 5,000 hectares of mangroves restored, 10 urban green spaces |
| **Gaps and Opportunities** | E.g., Limited wetland restoration, opportunity for agroforestry expansion |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (NbS coverage below 75% community protection by 2035) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use climate risk assessments, biodiversity maps, or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for data.
- Identify ecosystems and populations suitable for NbS, focusing on vulnerable groups.
- Assess gaps relative to Framework targets (e.g., 75% vulnerable communities protected by 2035).

**Example**: Region Z faces coastal flooding and drought, with mangroves and wetlands available for restoration. Current initiatives cover 5,000 hectares of mangroves, but broader wetland restoration is needed to meet the 75% protection target by 2035.

### 2. NbS Project Prioritization
Prioritize NbS projects based on climate, biodiversity, and community benefits, aligned with Framework goals.

| **NbS Project** | **Target Area/Population** | **Benefits** | **Priority (High/Medium/Low)** |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| E.g., Mangrove Restoration | Coastal communities (200,000 residents) | Flood protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity | High |
| E.g., Agroforestry | Smallholder farmers (50,000) | Soil health, food security, carbon storage | High |
| E.g., Urban Green Spaces | Urban populations (100,000) | Heatwave mitigation, air quality | Medium |
| E.g., Wetland Restoration | Rural communities (20,000) | Water security, biodiversity | Medium |

**Instructions**: 
- List potential NbS projects, detailing their benefits (e.g., adaptation, mitigation, social).
- Assign priorities based on impact, feasibility, and equity (High for projects benefiting vulnerable groups).
- Validate priorities with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy), ensuring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities.

**Example**: Region Z prioritizes mangrove restoration for 200,000 coastal residents (high flood risk) and agroforestry for 50,000 farmers (food insecurity), with indigenous community input via FPIC.

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Define a phased timeline for implementing NbS projects, aligned with Framework milestones.

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Actions** | **Milestones** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Short-Term | 2025-2030 | E.g., Restore 2,500 hectares of mangroves, pilot agroforestry for 10,000 farmers | E.g., 20% of coastal communities protected, 20% of farmers trained by 2030 |
| Medium-Term | 2030-2040 | E.g., Scale mangrove restoration to 10,000 hectares, expand agroforestry to 50,000 farmers | E.g., 75% of vulnerable communities protected by 2035 |
| Long-Term | 2040-2050 | E.g., Sustain NbS, integrate urban green spaces across 10 cities | E.g., 100% of vulnerable communities protected, net-zero contributions by 2050 |

**Instructions**: 
- Align with Framework milestones (e.g., 75% vulnerable communities protected by 2035, 100% by 2050).
- Coordinate with other sectors using the [Climate-Energy Policy Integration Matrix](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Engage stakeholders to validate timelines and ensure community ownership.

**Example**: By 2030, Region Z will protect 20% of coastal communities with 2,500 hectares of mangroves; by 2035, scale to 75% with 10,000 hectares; by 2050, achieve 100% protection and net-zero contributions.

### 5. Metrics for Success
Establish indicators to track progress and evaluate NbS outcomes, aligned with the Framework’s Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS).

| **Indicator** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Frequency** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Vulnerable Communities Protected | 75% by 2035, 100% by 2050 | Percentage of communities benefiting from NbS | Biennial |
| Ecosystem Restoration | 10,000 hectares of mangroves/wetlands by 2035 | Hectares restored, verified by satellite data | Annual |
| Carbon Sequestration | 1 MtCO2e annually by 2035 | Carbon storage from NbS projects | Annual |
| Biodiversity Gains | 20 endangered species protected by 2035 | Species population trends | Biennial |
| Community Benefits | 80% of local communities report benefits by 2035 | Surveys of job creation, livelihoods | Biennial |

**Instructions**: 
- Integrate metrics into ICMS for standardized reporting.
- Use satellite data, biodiversity surveys, and community feedback to assess restoration, sequestration, and benefits.
- Report progress via the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Track mangrove restoration annually (target: 10,000 hectares by 2035) and survey communities biennially to ensure 80% report benefits (e.g., jobs, fisheries) by 2035.
