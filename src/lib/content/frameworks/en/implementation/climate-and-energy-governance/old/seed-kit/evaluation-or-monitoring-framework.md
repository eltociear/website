# Evaluation or Monitoring Framework: Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework

## Introduction

The **Evaluation or Monitoring Framework** is a vital component of the *Climate Governance Seed Kit*, designed to enable stakeholders to track progress and measure the impact of climate and energy governance initiatives over time. This framework complements the **Governance Readiness Assessment Tool** by providing tools for ongoing evaluation, ensuring that actions align with the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*’s goals: achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035.

The framework integrates the Framework’s four pillars—Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology—and its principles, such as equity, transparency, and adaptive evolution. It offers a structured approach to define indicators, collect data, assess outcomes, and adapt strategies, with a focus on inclusivity and accountability. Aligned with the **Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS)**, it ensures standardized, transparent reporting across governance levels.

### Objectives
- Establish clear, measurable indicators to track progress toward Framework goals.
- Monitor the effectiveness and equity of climate and energy initiatives.
- Provide tools for data collection, analysis, and reporting.
- Enable adaptive management by identifying gaps and refining strategies.
- Foster transparency and stakeholder engagement in evaluation processes.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- CSOs advocating for climate action and equity
- Businesses aligning with climate goals
- Communities, particularly vulnerable and indigenous groups
- Regional organizations exploring coordination roles

### 1. Defining Evaluation Objectives
Set clear objectives for monitoring, aligned with Framework goals and pillars.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Objective** | E.g., Track progress toward 50% emissions reduction by 2035 |
| **Framework Goal** | E.g., Net-zero emissions by 2050, Climate Mitigation pillar |
| **Scope** | E.g., National carbon pricing policy, urban renewable energy deployment |
| **Stakeholders** | E.g., Policymakers, CSOs, rural communities, businesses |
| **Equity Focus** | E.g., Ensure low-income groups benefit from emissions reductions |
| **Timeframe** | E.g., Annual monitoring from 2025-2035 |

**Instructions**:
- Align objectives with Framework targets (e.g., 60% renewable energy by 2035).

### 3. Data Collection Plan
Outline methods and sources for collecting data, ensuring inclusivity and reliability.

| **Indicator** | **Data Source** | **Collection Method** | **Frequency** | **Responsible Party** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| CO2e emissions reduced | National emissions inventory | Automated monitoring systems | Annual | Environment Ministry |
| % of communities protected | Community surveys | Participatory assessments | Biennial | CSOs, local leaders |
| % of renewable energy | Energy grid data | Utility reports | Quarterly | Energy Agency |
| Clean tech patents | Patent office records | Database analysis | Annual | Innovation Hub |
| % of marginalized groups benefiting | Household surveys | Focus groups, digital platforms | Biennial | CSOs, community councils |

**Instructions**:
- Identify reliable data sources (e.g., government records, community input).
- Use inclusive methods (e.g., surveys in local languages, digital platforms like Decidim).
- Assign clear responsibilities, engaging stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Ensure data aligns with ICMS standards for interoperability.

**Example**: SolarNation collects emissions data annually from its inventory, renewable energy data quarterly from utilities, and rural access data biennially via community surveys in three languages, led by CSOs and reported via ICMS.

### 4. Analysis and Reporting
Analyze data to assess progress and report outcomes transparently.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Analysis Method** | E.g., Compare emissions data against 2035 target, assess equity via beneficiary surveys |
| **Key Questions** | E.g., Are emissions reductions on track? Are rural communities benefiting equitably? |
| **Tools Used** | E.g., Statistical software, ICMS dashboards, stakeholder feedback |
| **Reporting Format** | E.g., Annual report, infographics, [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) |
| **Audience** | E.g., Policymakers, communities, regional hubs |
| **Transparency Measures** | E.g., Publish raw data, host public webinars |

**Instructions**:
- Analyze data against targets, using ICMS tools for consistency.
- Address equity (e.g., disaggregate data by income, gender, or ethnicity).
- Report via the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) and the **Governance Communication Toolkit** for accessibility.
- Ensure transparency by sharing raw data and engaging stakeholders, per the **Radical Transparency** principle.

**Example**: SolarNation analyzes emissions reductions (8 MtCO2e by 2030 vs. 10 MtCO2e target) and rural access (60% vs. 80% target), using ICMS dashboards. Reports are published annually with infographics, shared via webinars, and uploaded to the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

### 5. Adaptive Management
Use evaluation findings to refine strategies and improve outcomes.

| **Finding** | **Implication** | **Action** | **Tool** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Emissions reduction below target | Insufficient carbon pricing enforcement | Strengthen policy via [Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) | Climate Institutional Reform Guide |
| Low rural energy access | Funding gaps for microgrids | Secure additional funds via [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) | Energy Transition Roadmap Template |
| Limited community input | Weak engagement processes | Enhance forums via [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) | Governance Communication Toolkit |

**Instructions**:
- Identify gaps or successes from analysis (e.g., underperforming indicators, equity issues).
- Propose actions using relevant Seed Kit tools (e.g., **Climate Finance Access Navigator** for funding).
- Engage stakeholders to validate adaptations, ensuring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities.
- Document changes for regional sharing via the [Regional Hub Connection Guide](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/hubs).

**Example**: SolarNation finds 60% rural energy access by 2030, below the 80% target. It secures $200M via the **Climate Finance Access Navigator**, enhances community forums with the **Stakeholder Engagement Protocol**, and shares lessons through a Regional Hub.
