# Climate Policy Brief Templates

## Introduction

The **Climate Policy Brief Templates** are essential tools within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to help stakeholders craft concise, evidence-based policy briefs to communicate climate and energy strategies effectively. These templates enable policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and other actors to summarize key policies, engage stakeholders, and report progress, aligning with the Framework’s goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035.

The templates integrate the Framework’s principles of equity, transparency, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, covering all four pillars: Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology. They provide three distinct formats—Policy Overview Brief, Stakeholder Engagement Brief, and Implementation Update Brief—to address different communication needs, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder inclusion.

### Objectives
- Summarize climate and energy policies for decision-makers and stakeholders.
- Communicate stakeholder engagement processes and outcomes to ensure transparency.
- Report implementation progress and challenges to maintain accountability.
- Align policy communication with Framework goals and pillars.
- Engage diverse audiences, including vulnerable communities, with clear and equitable messaging.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and communication teams
- CSOs advocating for climate action and equity
- Businesses aligning with climate policies
- General public, including vulnerable and indigenous communities

**Key Features**: Carbon tax of $50/tCO2e by 2026, scaling to $135/tCO2e by 2030; covers energy and industry; 50% of revenues for retraining, 30% for renewables.  
**Stakeholder Benefits**: Businesses gain investment certainty; 50,000 coal workers retrained; rural areas access clean energy.  
**Alignment with Framework**: Supports 50% emissions reduction by 2035; uses [Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).  
**Call to Action**: Endorse policy by Q2 2026; join stakeholder forums via [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
