# Just Transition Planning Template

## Introduction

The **Just Transition Planning Template** is a practical tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to support stakeholders in creating equitable strategies for workers and communities impacted by the shift from fossil fuel-based economies to clean, sustainable energy systems. A just transition ensures that the move to a net-zero, climate-resilient future does not exacerbate social or economic inequalities, providing retraining, economic diversification, and social safety nets for affected groups.

This template guides policymakers, regional authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in developing tailored just transition plans aligned with the Framework’s goals: achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, ensuring universal clean energy access, and building resilience for vulnerable communities. It integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, cooperation, and adaptability, and supports the implementation of just transition compacts as outlined in the Framework’s policy mechanisms.

### Objectives
- Identify workers and communities affected by the energy transition.
- Design targeted interventions (e.g., retraining, economic diversification) to support equitable outcomes.
- Engage stakeholders to ensure inclusive, participatory planning.
- Establish metrics to monitor and evaluate just transition progress.
- Align plans with Framework milestones (e.g., supporting 100% of affected workers by 2035).

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and economic development agencies
- Businesses transitioning from fossil fuel operations
- CSOs advocating for workers and marginalized communities
- Labor unions and community organizations

## Just Transition Plan

### 1. Context and Scope
Define the scope of your just transition plan, including the region, sector, and affected groups.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Region/Area** | E.g., Northern Coal Basin, Country X |
| **Sector(s)** | E.g., Coal mining, Oil and gas extraction |
| **Affected Groups** | E.g., 10,000 coal miners, 5,000 support workers, 3 rural communities |
| **Transition Drivers** | E.g., Coal phase-out by 2030, renewable energy targets (60% by 2035) |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Supports Framework’s just transition compact and 2035 milestone for 100% worker support |

**Example**: In the Northern Coal Basin, Country X, the plan addresses 10,000 coal miners and 3 rural communities impacted by a 2030 coal phase-out, aligning with the Framework’s target to support 100% of affected workers by 2035 through retraining and economic diversification.

---

### 2. Stakeholder Mapping
Identify key stakeholders and their roles in the just transition process.

| **Stakeholder Group** | **Role** | **Engagement Method** |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| E.g., Coal Miners’ Union | Represent workers, co-design retraining programs | Regular consultations, worker forums |
| E.g., Local Government | Allocate funding, implement diversification projects | Multi-stakeholder planning sessions |
| E.g., Renewable Energy Firms | Provide jobs, partner on retraining | Public-private partnership agreements |
| E.g., Indigenous Communities | Ensure cultural and land rights | Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes |
| E.g., CSOs | Advocate for equity, monitor outcomes | Community workshops, policy advocacy |

**Instructions**: Use the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to design inclusive engagement processes. Ensure marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous communities, low-income workers) have procedural rights.

**Example**: The Coal Miners’ Union will co-design a retraining program through monthly forums, while indigenous communities will exercise FPIC for any renewable energy projects on their lands.

---

### 3. Transition Interventions
Outline specific interventions to support affected workers and communities, focusing on retraining, economic diversification, and social safety nets.

#### 3.1 Retraining Programs
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Target Group** | E.g., 10,000 coal miners |
| **Skills Needed** | E.g., Solar panel installation, wind turbine maintenance |
| **Program Design** | E.g., 6-month vocational training, partnerships with renewable energy firms |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2026-2030, 2,000 workers trained annually |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., National climate budget, Framework finance via regional organizations |

**Example**: A 6-month retraining program will equip 10,000 coal miners with skills for solar and wind jobs by 2030, funded by a national climate budget and partnerships with renewable energy firms.

#### 3.2 Economic Diversification
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Target Area** | E.g., 3 rural coal-dependent communities |
| **New Industries** | E.g., Renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism |
| **Projects** | E.g., Community solar farms, organic farming cooperatives |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2027-2035, 1 project per community by 2030 |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., Framework finance, private investment |

**Example**: Three rural communities will develop community solar farms and organic farming cooperatives by 2030, funded by Framework finance and private investment, creating 1,500 new jobs.

#### 3.3 Social Safety Nets
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Target Group** | E.g., Displaced workers, low-income households |
| **Measures** | E.g., Income support for 2 years, healthcare access |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2025-2030, full coverage by 2028 |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., Carbon pricing revenues, national welfare budget |

**Example**: Displaced workers will receive 2 years of income support and healthcare access by 2028, funded by carbon pricing revenues redistributed to affected communities.

**Instructions**: Use the [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to identify funding. Ensure interventions prioritize equity for vulnerable groups.

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Define a phased timeline for implementing interventions, aligned with Framework milestones.

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Actions** | **Milestones** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Short-Term | 2025-2030 | E.g., Launch retraining programs, pilot solar farms, establish income support | E.g., 2,000 workers trained, 1 community solar farm operational by 2028 |
| Medium-Term | 2030-2040 | E.g., Scale retraining to 100% of workers, expand diversification projects | E.g., 100% worker support by 2035, 3 communities diversified by 2035 |
| Long-Term | 2040-2050 | E.g., Sustain new industries, monitor long-term outcomes | E.g., Self-sustaining renewable energy economy by 2050 |

**Instructions**: Align with the Framework’s Implementation Roadmap (e.g., 100% worker support by 2035). Use the [Energy Transition Roadmap Template](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for additional guidance.

**Example**: By 2028, 2,000 workers will be trained, and one community solar farm will be operational; by 2035, all workers will be supported, and all communities will have diversified economies.

### 5. Metrics for Success
Establish indicators to track progress and evaluate outcomes, aligned with the Framework’s Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS).

| **Indicator** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Frequency** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Workers Retrained | 100% by 2035 | Number of workers completing programs | Annual |
| New Jobs Created | 1,500 by 2035 | Employment records in new industries | Annual |
| Community Diversification | 3 communities by 2035 | Number of operational projects (e.g., solar farms) | Biennial |
| Income Support Coverage | 100% of displaced workers by 2028 | Percentage of eligible workers receiving support | Annual |
| Equity Outcomes | 80% of vulnerable groups supported by 2035 | Surveys of marginalized communities | Biennial |

**Instructions**: Integrate metrics into ICMS for standardized reporting. Use the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to visualize progress.

**Example**: Track the number of workers retrained annually (target: 2,000/year) and survey vulnerable communities biennially to ensure 80% feel supported by 2035.
