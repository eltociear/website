# Stakeholder Engagement Protocol

## Introduction

The **Stakeholder Engagement Protocol** is a core tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to ensure inclusive, equitable, and effective participation of all relevant stakeholders in climate and energy governance. This protocol provides a structured approach for policymakers, regional authorities, and governance actors to engage governments, businesses, civil society organizations (CSOs), indigenous communities, and marginalized groups in co-designing and implementing policies that align with the Framework’s goals: achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, universal clean energy access, and climate resilience for vulnerable communities.

The protocol upholds the Framework’s principles of equity, cooperation, ethical governance, and adaptability, emphasizing procedural rights (access to information, participation, and justice) and mechanisms like Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities. By fostering meaningful stakeholder engagement, the protocol ensures that climate and energy policies reflect diverse perspectives, address local needs, and build trust across sectors.

### Objectives
- Facilitate inclusive participation of all stakeholder groups in governance processes.
- Uphold procedural rights and FPIC to ensure equitable decision-making.
- Integrate stakeholder input into policy design, implementation, and monitoring.
- Build trust and collaboration across sectors to support Framework implementation.
- Evaluate engagement outcomes to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and governance bodies
- Businesses engaged in climate and energy transitions
- CSOs, including NGOs, labor unions, and youth groups
- Indigenous communities and marginalized groups

## Stakeholder Engagement Protocol

### 1. Engagement Principles
Adhere to the following principles to ensure effective and equitable stakeholder engagement, aligned with the Framework’s guiding principles:

| **Principle** | **Description** | **Application** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Inclusivity** | Engage all relevant stakeholders, prioritizing marginalized and vulnerable groups. | E.g., Include indigenous communities, low-income workers, and youth in forums. |
| **Equity** | Ensure equitable access to participation and influence, addressing power imbalances. | E.g., Provide translation services, accessible venues, and financial support for participation. |
| **Transparency** | Share information openly and communicate how stakeholder input is used. | E.g., Publish engagement outcomes and policy decisions on public platforms. |
| **Accountability** | Establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate engagement outcomes. | E.g., Use ICMS to track stakeholder participation rates and satisfaction. |
| **Respect for Rights** | Uphold procedural rights and FPIC for indigenous communities. | E.g., Implement FPIC processes for energy projects on indigenous lands. |
| **Adaptability** | Tailor engagement methods to local contexts and evolving needs. | E.g., Adjust consultation formats based on stakeholder feedback. |

**Instructions**: Integrate these principles into all engagement activities. Reference the Framework’s [Guiding Principles](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/docs/implementation/energy#02-guiding-principles) for further details.

### 2. Stakeholder Mapping
Identify and categorize stakeholders to ensure comprehensive engagement.

| **Stakeholder Group** | **Role** | **Interests/Needs** | **Engagement Priority** |
|-----------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| E.g., National Government | Policy development, funding allocation | Align policies with Framework targets | High |
| E.g., Indigenous Communities | Rights holders, knowledge contributors | Protect land rights, ensure FPIC | High |
| E.g., Businesses (Renewable Energy) | Job creation, technology deployment | Access to incentives, policy clarity | Medium |
| E.g., CSOs (NGOs, Unions) | Advocacy, community representation | Equity, just transition support | High |
| E.g., Local Communities | Affected by projects, beneficiaries | Job opportunities, resilience measures | High |

**Instructions**: 
- List all relevant stakeholders in your context, focusing on those affected by or influencing climate and energy policies.
- Assign engagement priorities (High, Medium, Low) based on their influence and impact.
- Use the [Just Transition Planning Template](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for stakeholder mapping in just transition contexts.

**Example**: Indigenous communities in Region Y are prioritized for FPIC processes due to proposed wind farms on their lands, while renewable energy businesses are engaged for job creation partnerships.

### 3. Engagement Methods
Select and implement engagement methods tailored to stakeholder needs and governance objectives.

| **Method** | **Description** | **Use Case** | **Resources Needed** |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Multi-Stakeholder Forums** | Public meetings to co-design policies or projects. | E.g., Regional forum to develop renewable energy plans. | Venue, facilitators, translation services. |
| **Consultations** | Targeted discussions with specific groups (e.g., indigenous communities). | E.g., FPIC consultations for energy projects. | Cultural mediators, legal advisors. |
| **Workshops** | Interactive sessions to build capacity or gather input. | E.g., Climate literacy workshop for youth groups. | Trainers, educational materials. |
| **Surveys/Polls** | Collect broad input on policy preferences or needs. | E.g., Survey workers on retraining preferences. | Online platforms, data analysts. |
| **Advisory Panels** | Formal stakeholder representation in governance bodies. | E.g., Business advisory panel for carbon pricing. | Administrative support, meeting schedules. |

**Instructions**:
