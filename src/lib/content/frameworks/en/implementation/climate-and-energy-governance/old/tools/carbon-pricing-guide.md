# Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The **Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide** is a critical tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to support stakeholders in designing and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This guide assists policymakers, regional authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in developing carbon pricing systems—such as carbon taxes or emissions trading systems (ETS)—that align with the Framework’s goals, including a 50% emissions reduction by 2035 and net-zero by 2050, while ensuring equitable outcomes for vulnerable communities and industries.

The guide integrates the Framework’s principles of sustainability, equity, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, with a focus on the Climate Mitigation pillar. It provides a structured approach to assess carbon pricing needs, design pricing mechanisms, ensure just transition measures, and monitor outcomes, fostering coordination across governance levels and sectors. By emphasizing stakeholder engagement and revenue recycling, the guide ensures that carbon pricing is both effective and socially acceptable.

### Objectives
- Assess the feasibility and context for implementing carbon pricing.
- Design science-based carbon pricing mechanisms aligned with Framework targets (e.g., $135/tCO2e by 2030).
- Integrate just transition measures to support affected workers and communities.
- Engage stakeholders to ensure inclusive and equitable policy design.
- Monitor and evaluate carbon pricing outcomes using standardized metrics.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Finance and environment ministries
- Businesses subject to or supporting carbon pricing
- CSOs advocating for climate action and equity
- Communities affected by carbon-intensive industries

## Carbon Pricing Implementation Guide

### 1. Carbon Pricing Context Assessment
Evaluate the current emissions profile, economic conditions, and policy frameworks to determine the feasibility of carbon pricing.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Emissions Profile** | E.g., 500 MtCO2e annually, 60% from energy, 20% from industry |
| **Economic Context** | E.g., GDP $1 trillion, energy-intensive industries employ 100,000 workers |
| **Existing Policies** | E.g., Fossil fuel subsidies ($10 billion/year), renewable energy incentives |
| **Carbon Pricing Status** | E.g., Pilot carbon tax ($20/tCO2e) in energy sector |
| **Stakeholder Readiness** | E.g., Business support for ETS, CSO concerns about equity |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (pricing below $135/tCO2e by 2030) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use national emissions inventories or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for data.
- Assess economic impacts (e.g., on industries, consumers) and stakeholder sentiments.
- Identify gaps (e.g., low pricing levels, lack of coverage) relative to Framework targets.

**Example**: Country X emits 500 MtCO2e annually, with a pilot carbon tax of $20/tCO2e in the energy sector. This falls short of the Framework’s $135/tCO2e target by 2030, requiring broader coverage and higher rates.

---

### 2. Carbon Pricing Mechanism Design
Design a carbon pricing mechanism (e.g., carbon tax, ETS) aligned with Framework targets and local context.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Mechanism Type** | E.g., Carbon tax, Emissions Trading System (ETS) |
| **Coverage** | E.g., Energy, industry, transport (80% of emissions) |
| **Price Level** | E.g., $50/tCO2e by 2026, scaling to $135/tCO2e by 2030 |
| **Revenue Use** | E.g., 50% for just transition, 30% for renewable energy, 20% for tax rebates |
| **Compliance Mechanisms** | E.g., Emissions monitoring via ICMS, fines for non-compliance |
| **Stakeholder Roles** | E.g., Businesses report emissions, CSOs monitor equity |

**Instructions**: 
- Choose a mechanism based on economic and political feasibility (e.g., tax for simplicity, ETS for market flexibility).
- Align price levels with Framework targets ($135/tCO2e by 2030, escalating to $200/tCO2e by 2040).
- Plan revenue recycling to support just transitions and renewable energy, using the [Just Transition Planning Template](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Engage stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to ensure buy-in.

**Example**: Country X will implement a carbon tax covering energy and industry (80% of emissions), starting at $50/tCO2e in 2026 and scaling to $135/tCO2e by 2030. Revenues will fund retraining for 50,000 workers (50%), renewable energy projects (30%), and household rebates (20%).

### 3. Just Transition Measures
Develop measures to support workers, communities, and industries affected by carbon pricing.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Affected Groups** | E.g., 50,000 coal workers, 10 energy-intensive firms, 5 rural communities |
| **Measures** | E.g., Retraining for green jobs, subsidies for low-carbon tech, income support |
| **Scope** | E.g., Retrain 10,000 workers annually, support 5 firms with $10M grants |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2025-2030, full worker support by 2035 |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., 50% of carbon tax revenues, Framework finance |

**Instructions**: 
- Identify groups impacted by carbon pricing (e.g., fossil fuel workers, low-income households).
- Design measures using the [Just Transition Planning Template](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy), prioritizing equity for vulnerable groups.
- Fund measures with carbon pricing revenues or the [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Ensure stakeholder input, including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities.

**Example**: Country X will retrain 50,000 coal workers for green jobs by 2035 and provide $10M in grants to 5 energy-intensive firms for low-carbon tech, funded by 50% of carbon tax revenues, with CSO input on equity.

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Define a phased timeline for implementing the carbon pricing mechanism and just transition measures.

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Actions** | **Milestones** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Short-Term | 2025-2030 | E.g., Launch carbon tax at $50/tCO2e, retrain 10,000 workers, phase out fossil fuel subsidies | E.g., 20% emissions reduction, 20% of workers retrained by 2030 |
| Medium-Term | 2030-2040 | E.g., Scale tax to $135/tCO2e, expand ETS to transport, support all affected workers | E.g., 50% emissions reduction, 100% worker support by 2035 |
| Long-Term | 2040-2050 | E.g., Maintain $200/tCO2e, sustain low-carbon industries | E.g., Net-zero emissions by 2050 |

**Instructions**: 
- Align with Framework milestones (e.g., 50% emissions reduction by 2035, net-zero by 2050).
- Coordinate with other sectors using the [Climate-Energy Policy Integration Matrix](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Engage stakeholders to validate timelines.

**Example**: By 2030, Country X will launch a $50/tCO2e carbon tax and retrain 10,000 workers; by 2035, scale to $135/tCO2e and support all workers; by 2050, achieve net-zero emissions.

### 5. Metrics for Success
Establish indicators to track progress and evaluate carbon pricing outcomes, aligned with the Framework’s Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS).

| **Indicator** | **Target** | **Measurement Method** | **Frequency** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| Emissions Reduction | 50% reduction by 2035 | MtCO2e from covered sectors | Annual |
| Carbon Price Level | $135/tCO2e by 2030, $200/tCO2e by 2040 | Price per tCO2e in tax/ETS | Annual |
| Revenue Allocation | 50% for just transition by 2030 | Percentage of revenues for retraining, rebates | Annual |
| Worker Support | 100% of affected workers supported by 2035 | Number of workers retrained/supported | Biennial |
| Equity Outcomes | 80% of vulnerable groups report benefits by 2035 | Surveys of low-income and marginalized communities | Biennial |

**Instructions**: 
- Integrate metrics into ICMS for standardized reporting.
- Use emissions data, revenue tracking, and surveys to assess reductions, equity, and worker support.
- Report progress via the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Track emissions reductions annually (target: 50% by 2035) and survey low-income communities biennially to ensure 80% report benefits from revenue-funded programs by 2035.
