## Climate Institutional Reform Guide

### 1. Institutional Capacity Assessment
Evaluate current institutional structures, capacities, and gaps to identify reform needs.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Current Institutions** | E.g., Ministry of Environment, Energy Agency, National Climate Council |
| **Mandates and Roles** | E.g., Environment Ministry oversees emissions; Energy Agency manages renewables |
| **Capacity Strengths** | E.g., Strong emissions monitoring team (50 experts), established renewable energy policies |
| **Capacity Gaps** | E.g., Limited inter-ministerial coordination, no dedicated adaptation unit, underfunded R&D |
| **Stakeholder Involvement** | E.g., CSOs engaged sporadically, indigenous groups underrepresented |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (lacks capacity for 50% emissions reduction by 2035) |
| **Governance Challenges** | E.g., Bureaucratic delays, overlapping mandates, limited public accountability |

**Instructions**: 
- Use the [Governance Readiness Assessment Tool](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to collect data.
- Map institutional roles and assess capacity against Framework targets (e.g., net-zero by 2050).
- Identify equity gaps (e.g., lack of community representation) and coordination issues.

**Example**: Country X’s Ministry of Environment monitors emissions but lacks a dedicated adaptation unit. Inter-ministerial coordination is weak, and indigenous groups are underrepresented, hindering progress toward the Framework’s 50% emissions reduction target by 2035.

---

### 2. Reform Priorities
Identify priorities for institutional reform to enhance climate and energy governance.

| **Priority** | **Objective** | **Target Institution** | **Framework Alignment** |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| E.g., Establish Climate Coordination Unit | Improve inter-ministerial collaboration | All ministries | Supports all pillars, 50% emissions reduction by 2035 |
| E.g., Create Adaptation Task Force | Strengthen adaptation planning | Environment Ministry | Climate Adaptation pillar, 75% community protection by 2035 |
| E.g., Fund Innovation Hub | Scale clean technology | Energy Agency | Innovation & Technology pillar, clean tech by 2030 |
| E.g., Enhance Stakeholder Inclusion | Ensure equity and transparency | National Climate Council | Equity principle, stakeholder engagement |

**Instructions**: 
- Prioritize reforms based on capacity gaps and Framework goals (e.g., 75% vulnerable communities protected by 2035).
- Ensure equity by including marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous communities) in reform processes.
- Validate priorities with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Country X prioritizes a Climate Coordination Unit to align ministries, an Adaptation Task Force for resilience, and inclusive stakeholder processes to meet Framework targets, with CSO and indigenous input.
