# Adaptation Planning Framework

## Introduction

The **Adaptation Planning Framework** is a vital tool within the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework*, designed to guide stakeholders in developing and implementing strategies to build climate resilience and protect vulnerable communities from climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather, and food insecurity. This framework supports policymakers, regional authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs), and communities in creating adaptation plans that align with the Framework’s goals, including protecting 75% of vulnerable communities by 2035 and 100% by 2050, while ensuring equitable outcomes and resilience across sectors.

The framework integrates the Framework’s principles of equity, sustainability, science-based decision-making, and cooperation, with a focus on the Climate Adaptation pillar. It provides a structured approach to assess climate risks, prioritize vulnerable populations, design adaptation measures, and monitor progress, fostering coordination across governance levels and sectors. By emphasizing stakeholder engagement and nature-based solutions, the framework ensures inclusive and sustainable adaptation planning.

### Objectives
- Assess climate risks and vulnerabilities at local, regional, and national levels.
- Prioritize adaptation measures for vulnerable communities and critical sectors.
- Design and implement equitable, science-based adaptation strategies.
- Engage stakeholders to ensure inclusive and participatory planning.
- Monitor and evaluate adaptation outcomes using standardized metrics.

### Target Audience
- National and regional policymakers
- National Implementation Units
- Regional authorities and disaster management agencies
- CSOs advocating for climate resilience and equity
- Communities, especially vulnerable and indigenous groups
- Businesses impacted by climate risks (e.g., agriculture, infrastructure)

## Adaptation Planning Framework

### 1. Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
Document climate risks, vulnerable populations, and affected sectors to establish a baseline for adaptation planning.

| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Climate Risks** | E.g., Sea level rise (1m by 2050), increased hurricanes, drought |
| **Vulnerable Populations** | E.g., 500,000 coastal residents, 100,000 smallholder farmers, indigenous communities |
| **Affected Sectors** | E.g., Agriculture, infrastructure, water resources |
| **Current Adaptation Measures** | E.g., Early warning systems (50% coverage), mangrove restoration (10,000 hectares) |
| **Vulnerability Gaps** | E.g., 50% of coastal communities unprotected, limited drought-resistant crops |
| **Alignment with Framework** | E.g., Partial alignment (adaptation coverage below 75% by 2035) |

**Instructions**: 
- Use climate risk assessments, national reports, or the [Climate Policy Dashboard](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) for data.
- Prioritize vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income, indigenous, rural) and critical sectors.
- Identify gaps in current measures relative to Framework targets.

**Example**: Region Y faces sea level rise and hurricanes, affecting 500,000 coastal residents and agriculture. Current early warning systems cover 50% of communities, falling short of the Framework’s 75% protection target by 2035.

---

### 2. Adaptation Priorities
Set priorities for adaptation, focusing on vulnerable populations and critical sectors, aligned with Framework milestones.

| **Priority** | **Target Group/Sector** | **Timeline** | **Description** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Coastal Protection | Coastal communities | 2035 | E.g., Protect 75% of coastal residents with barriers and nature-based solutions |
| Agricultural Resilience | Smallholder farmers | 2030 | E.g., Equip 80% of farmers with drought-resistant crops |
| Water Security | Rural communities | 2035 | E.g., Ensure 100% access to climate-resilient water systems |
| Disaster Preparedness | All vulnerable populations | 2030 | E.g., Achieve 100% coverage of early warning systems |

**Instructions**: 
- Align priorities with Framework goals (e.g., 75% vulnerable communities protected by 2035, 100% by 2050).
- Ensure equity by focusing on marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous communities, women).
- Validate priorities with stakeholders via the [Stakeholder Engagement Protocol](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).

**Example**: Region Y prioritizes protecting 75% of coastal residents by 2035 with mangroves and barriers, and equipping 80% of farmers with drought-resistant crops by 2030, with input from indigenous leaders.

#### 3.3 Community-Based Measures
| **Field** | **Response** |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Measure** | E.g., Early warning systems, climate-resilient farming training |
| **Target Group** | E.g., Rural farmers, indigenous communities |
| **Scope** | E.g., 100% early warning coverage, train 50,000 farmers |
| **Timeline** | E.g., 2025-2030, full coverage by 2028 |
| **Funding Source** | E.g., Regional funds, carbon pricing revenues |

**Instructions**: 
- Prioritize measures that combine infrastructure, nature-based, and community-based approaches.
- Ensure equity by targeting vulnerable groups and upholding Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for indigenous communities.
- Use the [Climate Finance Access Navigator](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy) to identify funding.

**Example**: Region Y will achieve 100% early warning system coverage by 2028 and train 50,000 farmers in climate-resilient practices by 2030, with FPIC for indigenous-led projects.

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
Define a phased timeline for implementing adaptation measures, aligned with Framework milestones.

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Actions** | **Milestones** |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Short-Term | 2025-2030 | E.g., Deploy early warning systems, restore 5,000 hectares of mangroves, train 20,000 farmers | E.g., 100% early warning coverage, 20% of farmers trained by 2030 |
| Medium-Term | 2030-2040 | E.g., Construct 100 km of coastal barriers, scale mangrove restoration to 20,000 hectares | E.g., 75% of vulnerable communities protected by 2035 |
| Long-Term | 2040-2050 | E.g., Sustain resilience measures, expand water security systems | E.g., 100% of vulnerable communities protected by 2050 |

**Instructions**: 
- Align with the Framework’s Implementation Roadmap (e.g., 75% protection by 2035, 100% by 2050).
- Coordinate with other sectors using the [Climate-Energy Policy Integration Matrix](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/tools/energy).
- Engage stakeholders to validate timelines.

**Example**: By 2030, Region Y will achieve 100% early warning coverage; by 2035, protect 75% of vulnerable communities with barriers and mangroves; by 2050, ensure 100% protection.
