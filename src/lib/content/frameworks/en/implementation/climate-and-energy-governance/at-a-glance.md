# Climate & Energy Governance Framework: At a Glance

> *"We pledge to recalibrate humanity's relationship with energy—from an extractive paradigm to one of symbiotic stewardship."*

## **🎯 The Big Picture**

**The Challenge**: Global energy systems generate 67% of greenhouse gas emissions while climate impacts accelerate beyond safe planetary boundaries.

**The Solution**: Transform global energy from fossil fuel extraction to community-owned clean energy abundance through democratic governance and international cooperation.

**The Vision**: By 2050, 80% community-owned renewable energy systems power thriving Bioregional Autonomous Zones, fossil fuel workers lead regenerative industries, and global cooperation prevents climate breakdown while healing damaged ecosystems.

## **⚡ Core Framework Elements**

### **Four Transformational Pillars**

**🌱 Pillar I: Radical Mitigation & Ecosystem Restoration**
- **Target**: Net-zero emissions by 2050 (55% reduction by 2035)
- **Method**: Carbon pricing + nature-based solutions funded through *Leaves* currency
- **Focus**: Industrial decarbonization via circular economy practices

**🏘️ Pillar II: Just & Sovereign Energy Transition**  
- **Target**: 90-100% clean energy by 2050 (80% community-owned)
- **Method**: Community Energy Cooperatives + fossil fuel subsidy phase-out
- **Focus**: Grid modernization for decentralized, resilient systems

**🛡️ Pillar III: Traditional Knowledge-Led Adaptation**
- **Target**: 75% vulnerable communities climate-resilient by 2035  
- **Method**: Indigenous knowledge + disaster preparedness + climate finance
- **Focus**: Infrastructure upgrades guided by traditional wisdom

**🌍 Pillar IV: Regenerative Energy Commons**
- **Target**: Cultural transformation toward energy abundance mindset
- **Method**: Community success stories + economic incentives via Regenerative Trade Zone
- **Focus**: Narrative shift from scarcity to community-owned abundance

## **🏛️ Governance Architecture**

### **Multi-Level Democratic Coordination**

**🌐 Global Oversight Body**
- Coordinates policies, monitors progress, enforces agreements
- **Emergency Powers**: Climate Emergency Clause triggered by Planetary Health Council
- **Enforcement**: Trade penalties, climate tariffs, green tech access restrictions

**🗺️ Regional Hubs** (Africa, Asia-Pacific, Americas)
- Tailor global goals to bioregional contexts
- Build capacity and resilience to political backsliding

**🏛️ National Implementation Units**
- Execute policies aligned with Paris Agreement NDCs
- Maintain sovereignty with fallback mechanisms during political shifts

## **💰 Economic Transformation**

### **Regenerative Finance Systems**

**💚 Hearts/Leaves Currency Integration**
- **Hearts**: Rewards for community energy governance and democratic participation
- **Leaves**: Payments for ecosystem restoration and energy conservation
- **Local Multiplier**: Keep energy wealth in communities vs. extracting to corporations

**💼 Just Transition Support**
- **5-Year Income Guarantee**: 100% wage replacement declining to 70% for fossil fuel workers
- **Retraining Programs**: Comprehensive renewable energy career transition
- **Legacy Transition Fund**: Fossil fuel industry funds complete worker and community transition

**🌱 Community Wealth Building**
- **Community Dividends**: Annual payments from energy cooperative profits
- **Local Investment**: Energy profits fund infrastructure, housing, education
- **Worker Cooperatives**: Former fossil fuel workers form democratic businesses

## **💡 The Transformation**

**From**: Fossil fuel extraction → Corporate control → Climate breakdown → Energy poverty  
**To**: Community ownership → Energy democracy → Climate stability → Energy abundance

**The Promise**: This framework proves the most effective climate action also creates the most just and democratic energy system. Community ownership doesn't just fight climate change—it builds the foundation for thriving, resilient communities.

**The Call**: The science is clear. The technologies exist. The financing is achievable. What remains is collective commitment to choose regeneration over extraction, community ownership over corporate control, and planetary stewardship over short-term profits.
