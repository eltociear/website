This governance structure ensures that humanity's response to the climate crisis enhances rather than undermines democracy, centers Indigenous wisdom and frontline community leadership, and creates robust safeguards against authoritarian capture during crisis periods. As Indigenous climate leaders demand: "our Indigenous perspectives, our Indigenous knowledge be included in those processes and the decision around adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage funds; that our right to self-determination is part of this whole process."

The result is governance architecture that can coordinate rapid, global-scale transformation while honoring the sovereignty and wisdom of the communities who must live with the consequences of climate and energy decisions for generations to come.
