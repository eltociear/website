The financing framework mobilizes unprecedented resources while ensuring they serve community empowerment rather than corporate extraction. Through diverse funding sources, community-controlled allocation, reparative justice principles, and financial system transformation, it proves that climate action can build rather than undermine community wealth and economic democracy.

This creates the "largest wealth creation opportunity on the planet" that Jigar Shah envisions—but structured to ensure the wealth flows to communities leading energy transformation rather than concentrating in corporate hands. The result is climate finance that heals rather than reproduces economic injustices while mobilizing the resources necessary for planetary transformation.
