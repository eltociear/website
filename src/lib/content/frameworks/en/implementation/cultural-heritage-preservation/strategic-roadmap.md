# Strategic roadmap

[Back to Framework Overview](/frameworks/cultural-heritage-preservation)

The Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework unfolds through three strategic phases over 25 years (2025-2050), with each phase building on the successes of the previous while maintaining flexibility for community-led adaptation. This roadmap balances ambitious transformation with realistic implementation timelines, prioritizing **learning from pilots, scaling proven approaches, and continuous community feedback**.

## Implementation philosophy

**Start small, learn deeply, scale wisely**: Rather than attempting global rollout immediately, the framework begins with carefully selected pilot BAZs representing diverse contexts. Success criteria are community-defined, not externally imposed. Scaling happens when communities report genuine value, not according to predetermined schedules.

**Sovereignty throughout**: Every phase maintains absolute BAZ authority over heritage decisions. No "training wheels" period where external control is justified—communities govern from day one.

**Adaptive timelines**: While phases have target years, actual progression depends on demonstrated success and community readiness. Some regions may advance faster, others may need more time. Both approaches are valid.

**Parallel tracks**: Rather than sequential development, multiple activities proceed simultaneously—language revitalization alongside repatriation, digital infrastructure alongside traditional preservation, governance establishment alongside practical heritage work.

## Phase 1 (2025-2030): Foundation building

### Core objectives

**Establish governance infrastructure**: Create the Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council and initial BAZ network with sufficient resources and authority to demonstrate framework viability.

**Prove concept through pilots**: Launch 5 diverse pilot BAZs that test framework mechanisms in varied contexts, generating learnings for broader scaling.

**Begin urgent preservation**: Prioritize most endangered languages and most critical repatriation cases, preventing irreversible losses while building capacity.

**Build technical infrastructure**: Deploy quantum-safe archives and Love Ledger systems that provide secure, community-controlled foundation for digital preservation.

### Year 1 (2025): Governance establishment and pilot selection

**Q1-Q2: Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council formation**
- Convene Indigenous leaders from major bioregions for Council composition discussions
- Establish FPIC 2.0 protocols for Council participation
- Develop Council charter, decision-making processes, and accountability mechanisms
- Select initial Council members using BAZ nomination processes
- Secure initial $20M funding from philanthropic foundations and early Stewardship Bond purchases

**Q3: Pilot BAZ selection**
- Issue global call for pilot participation with clear selection criteria
- Prioritize diversity: urban/rural, different continents, varied colonial histories, climate vulnerability levels
- Select 5 pilot BAZs representing:
  1. **Indigenous-led rural BAZ** (e.g., Amazon, Sápmi, or Australian Aboriginal territory)
  2. **Urban Indigenous BAZ** (e.g., North American city with significant Native population)
  3. **Post-conflict BAZ** (e.g., Bosnia, Rwanda, or post-war Middle East)
  4. **Climate-vulnerable BAZ** (e.g., Pacific Island, Arctic, or coastal Bangladesh)
  5. **Diaspora Hub** (e.g., African diaspora in Europe or Americas)

**Q4: Initial pilot funding and planning**
