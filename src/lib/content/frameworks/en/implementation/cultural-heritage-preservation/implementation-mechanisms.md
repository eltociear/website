# Implementation mechanisms

[Back to Framework Overview](/frameworks/cultural-heritage-preservation)

The Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework operates through concrete mechanisms that translate principles and governance structures into tangible action. These mechanisms are designed for **community control, practical effectiveness, and scalability** while maintaining flexibility for diverse cultural contexts.

## FPIC 2.0: Enhanced consent protocols

Free, Prior, and Informed Consent has been the foundation of Indigenous rights frameworks, but traditional FPIC often lacked enforcement mechanisms and didn't account for digital contexts. **FPIC 2.0** addresses these gaps while strengthening community authority.

### Core enhancements beyond traditional FPIC

**Digital context protections**:
- Explicit consent required for AI training data using cultural knowledge
- Control over digital archiving, scanning, and documentation
- Authority over online sharing, streaming, and digital distribution
- Veto power over algorithm design affecting cultural content

**Revocable consent authority**:
- Communities can withdraw consent at any time
- Projects must cease within 48 hours of revocation
- No penalties for withdrawal—refunds of any prepaid fees
- Communities need not justify revocation decisions

**Benefit-sharing requirements**:
- Clear, enforceable agreements about economic benefits
- Minimum 60% revenue to source communities for commercial use
- Ongoing royalties, not one-time payments
- Community authority to renegotiate terms based on actual commercial success

**Enhanced information standards**:
- Information provided in community's primary languages
- Time for community deliberation according to traditional processes
- Independent technical review available at no cost to communities
- Plain language explanations, not just legal documents

**Veto authority**:
- Communities can reject projects even after initial exploration
- Veto applies to the entire project, not just modifications
- No required justification—"no" means "no"
- Treaty enforcement mechanisms back up veto authority

### Implementation through BAZ governance

**FPIC 2.0 protocols are enforced through**:

**BAZ-level consent processes**:
- Traditional decision-making procedures determine consent
- No external timelines imposed—communities decide deliberation length
- Elder councils, youth representatives, and affected families all involved
- Ceremony and spiritual consultation integrated as appropriate

**Love Ledger tracking**:
- All consent agreements recorded on blockchain for transparency
- Access logs show who has viewed/used cultural knowledge
- Automatic benefit distribution based on agreed percentages
- Public verification of proper consent process

**Digital Justice Tribunal enforcement**:
- BAZs can file complaints about FPIC 2.0 violations
- Tribunal has authority to halt projects and impose penalties
- Criminal liability possible for egregious violations (Treaty Ecocide law)
- Precedent-setting cases establish strong protection standards

**Red Lines protection**:
- Communities can designate non-negotiable boundaries
- Sacred knowledge never subject to consent negotiations
- Certain sites remain permanently closed regardless of economic offers
- Technologies can be categorically rejected (e.g., particular AI applications)

### Practical application examples

**Language documentation project**:
1. External researchers propose documentation of endangered language
2. BAZ conducts community consultation using traditional processes
3. Elders decide which aspects can be documented, which remain oral-only
4. Youth representatives ensure documentation serves future language learners
5. Agreement specifies: data storage location (BAZ servers), access permissions (community-controlled), benefit sharing (100% to language revitalization program)
6. Recorded on Love Ledger with cryptographic consent verification
7. Community can revoke consent if project deviates from agreement

**Sacred site tourism**:
1. Tourism operator requests limited access to ceremonial site
2. BAZ uses FPIC 2.0 to determine if any access is acceptable
3. Community may decide: no access (Red Line), limited access with strict protocols, or conditional seasonal access
4. If allowing access: visitor numbers capped, ceremonial times excluded, cultural education required, 80% revenue to community
5. BAZ retains authority to immediately close site if protocols violated
6. Annual community review determines if access continues

## Financing mechanisms

Cultural preservation requires sustained, reliable funding. The framework creates multiple complementary funding streams ensuring economic viability without compromising sovereignty.

### Stewardship Bonds

**Purpose**: Dedicated investment instruments for cultural preservation, providing large-scale capital for infrastructure and long-term projects.

### AUBI integration: Hearts and Leaves currencies

The Adaptive Universal Basic Income Framework provides ongoing economic support for cultural preservation work through its Layer 2 and Layer 3 mechanisms.

**Layer 1 foundation ($500/month basic income)**:
- De-risks cultural work by ensuring survival security
- Enables people to pursue heritage preservation without economic penalty
- 70% fiat currency, 30% Hearts ensures integration with existing economy
- Universal—everyone receives it regardless of employment status

**Layer 2: Hearts currency for cultural work**:
- Earned by Cultural Stewardship Teams providing community services
- Language teaching, traditional knowledge transmission, ceremony facilitation
- Cultural healing work, art creation, storytelling
- Digital documentation, archive management, youth mentorship
- Heritage site maintenance, museum curation, cultural education

**How Hearts work**:
1. Cultural Stewardship Teams register as Community Providers
2. Community members spend AUBI Hearts to access cultural services (e.g., language classes, traditional craft workshops, cultural tours)
3. Teams earn Hearts revenue from community spending
4. Hearts redeemed for fiat currency at Hearts Treasury
5. Enables cultural workers to earn viable livelihoods through heritage preservation

**Layer 3: Leaves currency for biocultural stewardship**:
- Earned for ecological work protecting biocultural sites
- Sacred site guardianship, traditional land management
- Ecosystem restoration using traditional ecological knowledge
- Climate adaptation for cultural landscapes
- Biodiversity protection in ceremonial territories

**Economic flow**:
```
Community member receives AUBI (Layer 1)
→ Spends Hearts on cultural services from Stewardship Team
→ Team earns Hearts revenue
→ Team redeems Hearts for fiat at Treasury
→ Cultural workers earn sustainable livelihoods
```

**Additional benefits**:
- Cultural work recognized as economically valuable, not charity
- Market-like mechanisms without exploitative capitalism
- Community spending decisions determine which cultural services thrive
- Automatic, transparent tracking via Love Ledger

### Treaty P4 contributions

The Treaty for Our Only Home's Planetary Proportionate Contribution (P4) mechanism provides public funding streams:

**Allocation priorities**:

- Photography and physical photo albums
- Hand-written records in community archives
- Audio cassettes and CDs for communities preferring physical media

**Hybrid approaches**:
- Digital backups of analog materials (when communities choose)
- Periodic digitization without replacing analog originals
- Physical copies of digital materials for redundancy
- Community choice about balance between analog and digital

**Distribution**:
- Kits provided free to BAZs requesting them
- Training in use provided by Community Weavers
- Regular resupply of consumable materials
- No pressure to adopt digital methods

## Biocultural protocols

Cultural preservation cannot be separated from ecosystem protection. These protocols ensure integrated biocultural stewardship.

### Sacred site guardianship

**Protected under Treaty Ecocide law**:
- Mountains, groves, water sources with ceremonial significance
- Burial grounds and ancestral territories
- Sites of historical events important to cultural identity
- Places where traditional ceremonies must occur

**Guardianship mechanisms**:
- Cultural Stewardship Teams assigned to site protection
- Earning both Hearts (cultural work) and Leaves (ecological stewardship)
- Legal authority to exclude destructive activities
- Training in conservation alongside traditional protocols

**Climate adaptation**:
- Monitoring climate impacts on sacred sites
- Traditional ecological knowledge applied to adaptation
- Emergency protection for sites facing imminent threats
- Migration documentation if sites become uninhabitable

### Seasonal calendars

**Integration of cultural and ecological cycles**:

## International legal alignment

The framework builds upon and strengthens existing international legal protections.

**UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)**:
- Framework operationalizes UNDRIP's cultural rights provisions
- Provides enforcement mechanisms UNDRIP currently lacks
- FPIC 2.0 implements UNDRIP's consent requirements
- BAZ sovereignty realizes UNDRIP's self-determination principles

**UNESCO World Heritage Convention**:
- 50% of UNESCO sites under BAZ management by Phase 2
- Communities become primary decision-makers, not just consultees
- Cultural criteria prioritized over tourism revenue
- Indigenous nomination processes strengthened

**Hague Convention for Protection of Cultural Property**:
- Extended to cover intangible heritage and traditional knowledge
- Ecocide law provides stronger enforcement than current treaty
- Digital heritage protection added to physical property
- Repatriation mechanisms enhanced beyond current standards

**Convention on Biological Diversity (Nagoya Protocol)**:
- Traditional ecological knowledge protections integrated
- Benefit-sharing strengthened through Love Ledger tracking
- Community control enhanced beyond current "access and benefit-sharing"
- Climate adaptation for biocultural sites added

The framework doesn't replace these treaties but **operationalizes and strengthens them** through concrete mechanisms and enforcement.
