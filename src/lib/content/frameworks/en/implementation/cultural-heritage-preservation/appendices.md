## Appendix C: Cultural Vitality Index methodology

### Overview and purpose

The Cultural Vitality Index (CVI) measures cultural health through a weighted combination of language vitality, community engagement, and biocultural health. It serves as both a lagging indicator (measuring outcomes) and a leading indicator (predicting future cultural health).

**Key principle**: Quantitative data must be validated by qualitative community assessment to prevent gaming and ensure metrics reflect genuine cultural flourishing.

### Three-domain formula

**CVI = (0.40 × Language Vitality) + (0.30 × Community Engagement) + (0.30 × Biocultural Health)**

Each domain scored 0-100, with final CVI 0-100 where:
- **`<`40%**: Crisis (culture in immediate danger)
- **40-60%**: Vulnerable (significant threats, urgent intervention needed)
- **60-80%**: Stable (culture maintained but not thriving)
- **`>`80%**: Thriving (culture flourishing and self-sustaining)

### Domain 1: Language vitality (40% of CVI)

### Validation process

**Monthly community reflection circles**:
- Cultural Stewardship Teams review quantitative data
- Discussion: "Do these numbers reflect genuine cultural health?"
- Identify discrepancies, gaming attempts, measurement problems
- Adjust scores if data doesn't reflect reality
- Document qualitative observations

**Quarterly elder council validation**:
- Quantitative scores presented to elder council
- Elders provide narrative assessment of cultural state
- Youth council provides complementary assessment
- If major discrepancy: Investigation and score adjustment
- Final CVI integrates quantitative data with elder wisdom

**Annual comprehensive assessment**:
- Full-year CVI trends analyzed
- Deep community dialogue on cultural state
- Stories and narratives compiled
- External validation by peer BAZs (optional)
- Transparent reporting via Love Ledger

### Preventing gaming

**Multiple data sources**:
- Community surveys
- Direct observation
- Traditional knowledge holder interviews
- Youth focus groups
- Participatory assessment workshops

**Triangulation**:
- Cross-check quantitative data with qualitative narratives
- Compare self-reported data with external observations
- Look for inconsistencies suggesting inflation

**Elder veto authority**:
- If elders say "numbers don't reflect reality," scores adjusted downward
- Community trust in elder wisdom prevents successful gaming
- Investigation of why gaming occurred, addressing root causes

**No punishment for "poor" scores**:
- Low CVI triggers support, never funding cuts
- Removes incentive to inflate scores
- Encourages honest assessment enabling genuine help

### Using CVI data

**Resource allocation**:
- BAZs with declining CVI receive priority support
- Emergency preservation funding for crisis-level scores
- Successful BAZs mentor struggling ones

**Progress tracking**:
- Baseline established Year 1
- Annual tracking shows trends
- 5% Phase 1 target, 10% Phase 2, 80% Phase 3

**Learning and adaptation**:
- Identify which interventions improve CVI
- Share successful approaches across BAZ network
- Continuous refinement of measurement methods

**Advocacy and accountability**:
- Demonstrate cultural preservation value
- Prove framework effectiveness
- Transparent public reporting builds trust

## Appendix D: Technology governance protocols

### TGIF integration principles

The Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework's technology systems adhere to the Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) principles:

**1. Algorithmic transparency**: All AI and automated systems must explain their decision-making logic in ways communities can understand.

**2. Human-in-the-loop oversight**: Technology assists human judgment, never replaces it. Traditional knowledge holders retain final authority.

**3. Community veto power**: Communities can immediately shut down any technology system they deem problematic, no questions asked.

**4. Data sovereignty**: Communities control all data about their culture—where it's stored, who accesses it, how it's used.

**5. Benefit sharing**: If technology generates economic value using community data or knowledge, communities receive fair compensation.

### AI ethics guidelines for Cultural AI Sandboxes

**Access controls**:
- Role-based permissions (public, restricted, sacred)
- Traditional knowledge succession systems control sacred data access
- Time-limited access tokens requiring periodic reauthorization
- Revocable access (can be withdrawn immediately)
- Emergency access protocols for data recovery

**Breach response protocol**:
1. Immediate detection and containment (within 1 hour)
2. Affected communities notified (within 4 hours)
3. Full investigation (within 24 hours)
4. Public disclosure of breach details (within 48 hours)
5. Remediation and system hardening (within 1 week)
6. Legal action against violators
7. Community ceremony/healing for sacred knowledge violation

### Deepfake prevention and detection

## Appendix E: Repatriation mechanisms

### Overview

Repatriation returns looted cultural heritage to source communities. The framework provides clear procedures ensuring swift, fair return while respecting both community needs and legitimate conservation concerns.

### Identification and claims process

**Step 1: Heritage inventory** (BAZ responsibility)
- Identify items held by museums, private collections, governments
- Document evidence of theft or illegitimate acquisition
- Prioritize sacred objects, human remains, ceremonial items
- Create publicly accessible claims database

**Step 2: Claim filing** (Digital Justice Tribunal)
- Submit claim with: item description, evidence of origin, proof of theft
- Burden of proof on institution to show legitimate acquisition
- Expedited process for clearly stolen items
- Legal representation provided if BAZ requests

**Step 3: Investigation** (30-60 days)
- Tribunal investigates acquisition history
- Expert testimony on cultural significance
- Institution must prove legitimate purchase/gift
- Community testimony about item's importance

**Step 4: Tribunal decision** (60-90 days from claim)
- Three-judge panel (one BAZ-nominated, one neutral, one heritage expert)
- Decision based on: evidence of theft, cultural significance, conservation needs
- Binding international ruling
- Appeal only on procedural grounds

**Step 5: Return logistics** (60-180 days from decision)
- Institution funds return transport
- Conservation assessment and stabilization if needed
- Community preparation for appropriate housing
- Ceremonial return when culturally appropriate

### Priority tiers

**Tier 1: Immediate return** (sacred objects and human remains)
