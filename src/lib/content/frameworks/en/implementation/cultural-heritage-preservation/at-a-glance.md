# Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework: At a glance

[Back to Framework Overview](/frameworks/cultural-heritage-preservation)

## The crisis in one sentence

**Indigenous languages disappear every two weeks, museums hold millions of looted artifacts, climate threatens irreplaceable sites, and communities face economic pressure to commodify traditions—yet we have the knowledge and tools to preserve humanity's cultural heritage if we act with sovereignty and solidarity.**

## What is Project Tapestry?

The **Cultural Memory Operating System** for humanity's collective heritage—embedding cultural preservation principles, protocols, and standards within global governance frameworks (Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, Meta-Governance) to ensure no culture is lost while communities maintain complete sovereignty.

## The vision (2050)

Every culture has:
- **Sovereignty** over heritage decisions (via Bioregional Autonomous Zones)
- **Economic security** for cultural workers (via AUBI Hearts/Leaves)  
- **Legal protection** for sacred sites (via Treaty Ecocide law)
- **Technology** serving communities (quantum-safe archives, AI under community control)
- **Tools to evolve** while maintaining continuity with ancestors

## Core principles (11)

1. **Sovereign stewardship** - BAZs hold authority, FPIC 2.0 non-negotiable
2. **Living heritage** - Cultures evolve; innovation equals preservation
3. **Biocultural unity** - Culture inseparable from ecosystems
4. **Ethical access** - Community-consented sharing via blockchain
5. **Reparative justice** - Restitution for looted heritage
6. **Intergenerational equity** - Guided by elders and youth
7. **Decentralized guardianship** - Distributed, not centralized control
8. **Cultural hybridity** - Support diasporas and syncretic identities
9. **Cosmic continuity** - Prepare for interplanetary contexts
10. **Technological harmony** - Tech serves, doesn't replace humans
11. **Inclusive representation** - Intersectional diversity in governance

## Governance architecture

**Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council** (Meta-Governance)
- 40% Indigenous | 30% Heritage Professionals | 20% Youth | 10% Diaspora
- Coordinates frameworks, manages Stewardship Bonds
- Serves BAZs, doesn't control them

**Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)** (Primary Authority)
- Sovereignty over heritage in their territories
- FPIC 2.0 protocols, Red Lines protection
- Earn AUBI Hearts/Leaves for cultural work

**Cultural Stewardship Teams** (Implementation)
- Community Work Teams within BAZs
- Organized under Work in Liberation Framework
- Democratic governance, peer support

## Key mechanisms

**FPIC 2.0**: Enhanced consent—free, prior, informed, revocable, with benefit-sharing

**Stewardship Bonds**: $100M Phase 1 → $1B Phase 2 → $5B Phase 3

**AUBI Integration**: Hearts (care work) + Leaves (ecological work) = viable cultural livelihoods

**Treaty Legal Authority**: Ecocide law protects biocultural sites, Digital Justice Tribunal enforces rights

**Quantum-Safe Archives**: Community-controlled, encrypted, distributed digital preservation

**Love Ledger**: Blockchain transparency for funding, consent, provenance, benefits

## Six major innovations

1. **Living Heritage Licenses** - Dynamic IP enabling commercialization with sovereignty
2. **Cultural AI Sandboxes** - Ethical AI with mandatory oversight and community veto
3. **Generational Knowledge Banks** - 25/50/100-year time capsules for descendants
4. **Heritage Entrepreneurship** - Grants for culturally-aligned, self-sustaining businesses
5. **Cultural Vitality Index** - Measuring what matters with elder validation
6. **Cultural Innovation Labs** - Youth-led contemporary creation earning Hearts

## Implementation timeline

**Phase 1 (2025-2030): Foundation**
- 5 pilot BAZs, 100 languages documented
- $100M Stewardship Bonds, 1,000 stewards trained
- 30% artifact repatriation, 5% CVI increase

**Phase 2 (2030-2040): Expansion**
- 50 BAZs, 1,000 languages with digital tools
- $1B Stewardship Bonds, 50% UNESCO sites under BAZ management
- 10% CVI increase, cultural chamber in Digital Justice Tribunal

**Phase 3 (2040-2050): Maturity**
- 200 BAZs, all living languages preserved
- $5B in Heritage Enterprises, 80% CVI (thriving)
- Cultural Impact Assessments mandatory globally

## Funding sources

- **Stewardship Bonds**: $6.1B total (investors earn 3-5% return)
- **Treaty P4**: $750M total (public contributions)
- **AUBI Hearts/Leaves**: $610M total (ongoing cultural work compensation)
- **Heritage Enterprises**: $5B+ by 2050 (earned revenue)
- **Philanthropic**: $75M (catalytic grants)

## Current status (November 2025)

**Reality check**: This is currently **grassroots vision**, not formal organization
- One person working on Global Governance Framework ecosystem
- Comprehensive design ready for community review
- Open licensing enabling free use and adaptation
- Seeking Indigenous leaders, funders, partners to bring it to life

**What we have**: Deep research, careful design, genuine commitment to sovereignty

**What we need**: People, resources, and communities to transform vision into reality

## Why it could work

✅ Built on proven concepts (FPIC, community control, participatory economics)
✅ Innovative mechanisms addressing 21st century challenges
✅ Deep integration with complementary frameworks
✅ Sovereignty absolute throughout
✅ Economic sustainability designed-in
✅ Technology serving, not extracting
✅ Legal enforcement backing
✅ Concrete implementation pathways

## Critical success factors

**Indigenous leadership** - Without genuine Indigenous authority, don't proceed

**Economic viability** - Cultural workers must earn livelihoods, not volunteer

**Technology ethics** - Community control non-negotiable, no corporate extraction

**Legal backing** - Treaty ratification and enforcement essential

**Patient funding** - Cultural revitalization takes decades, not quarters

**Continuous learning** - Adaptation based on community feedback

## How to engage

**Indigenous communities**: Explore critically, adapt useful pieces, provide feedback

**Funders**: Support pilots, infrastructure, and long-term sustainability

**Technologists**: Build community-controlled systems under Indigenous sovereignty

**Researchers**: Conduct participatory research serving community priorities

**Policy makers**: Remove barriers, recognize sovereignty, fund preservation

**Everyone**: Learn, share, support Indigenous-led movements, challenge appropriation

## The choice

Every day without action, languages die, knowledge disappears, sites erode. 

Every day with action, cultures gain tools, sovereignty strengthens, futures open.

**The cultural heritage we save or lose in the next decade shapes humanity for millennia.**

The question is whether enough people recognize the urgency and act with the integrity the moment demands.
