# Governance structure

[Back to Framework Overview](/frameworks/cultural-heritage-preservation)

The Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework operates through a multi-layered governance architecture that honors Indigenous sovereignty while enabling planetary coordination. This structure is fundamentally different from traditional hierarchical governance—power flows from communities upward through voluntary participation, not from global institutions downward through imposed authority.

**Key design principles**:
- **Sovereignty first**: BAZs hold ultimate authority over heritage within their territories
- **Voluntary coordination**: Global and regional structures serve communities, never control them
- **Polycentric power**: Multiple centers of authority coordinate horizontally
- **Subsidiarity**: Decisions made at most local level possible
- **Earned legitimacy**: Authority comes from demonstrated service to communities, not imposed hierarchy

## Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council

### Role and authority

The Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council (CAWC) is a specialized **Meta-Governance Coordination Council** operating under the Earth Council's moral authority. It coordinates cultural preservation across the Global Governance Framework ecosystem while respecting absolute BAZ sovereignty.

**What the Council does**:
- Defines recommended (not mandatory) standards for cultural preservation
- Manages Stewardship Bonds and allocates resources to BAZ-led projects
- Coordinates with other frameworks (AUBI, Work in Liberation, Treaty)
- Oversees repatriation processes through the Digital Justice Tribunal's cultural chamber
- Facilitates knowledge sharing between BAZs
- Provides technical infrastructure (quantum-safe archives, Love Ledger systems)

**What the Council does NOT do**:
- Control BAZ cultural decisions or override community sovereignty
- Require participation or punish non-participation
- Impose standardized approaches across diverse cultural contexts
- Access restricted cultural knowledge without explicit FPIC 2.0 consent
- Make decisions affecting specific communities without their involvement

The Council operates as a **service organization** coordinating willing participants, not a governing body imposing rules on subjects.

### Composition: Centering Indigenous leadership

The Council's 40% Indigenous representation isn't tokenism—it's recognition that Indigenous communities have successfully preserved cultural heritage for millennia and should lead global coordination efforts.

| Council Component | Percentage | Selection Process | Authority |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Indigenous representatives** | 40% | BAZ-nominated, FPIC 2.0-protected | Full voting rights, veto on Indigenous issues |
| **Heritage professionals** | 30% | Expert nomination by peer organizations | Full voting rights, advisory on technical issues |
| **Youth delegates (18-35)** | 20% | Youth council elections | Full voting rights, veto on long-term impacts |
| **Diasporic representatives** | 10% | Diaspora community nomination | Full voting rights, special focus on non-territorial heritage |
| **Technology advisors** | Advisory only | Technical organization nomination | No voting rights, provide technical guidance |

**Key provisions**:

**Indigenous veto power**: The 40% Indigenous representatives can collectively veto any decision affecting Indigenous heritage, traditional knowledge, or BAZ sovereignty. This isn't a formality—it's enforceable protection against appropriation or exploitation.

**Youth authority on long-term decisions**: Youth representatives (20%) hold veto power over decisions with impacts extending beyond 20 years, implementing intergenerational equity principles. This recognizes that youth will live with consequences of today's decisions.

**Rotating BAZ leadership**: The Council chair rotates among BAZ representatives every 18 months, ensuring diverse cultural perspectives shape leadership and preventing power consolidation.

**Term limits**: All positions have 5-year term limits with mandatory 2-year breaks before re-election, preventing institutional capture and ensuring fresh perspectives.

### Selection processes ensuring legitimacy

**Indigenous representatives (40%)**:
- Nominated by BAZs using their own traditional selection processes
- No external vetting or approval required—BAZ choices are final
- Protected by FPIC 2.0: representatives can withdraw at any time
- Compensated via AUBI Hearts for council service time
- Cultural protocols respected (ceremony time, language access, traditional decision-making)

**Heritage professionals (30%)**:
- Nominated by professional organizations (archaeologists, archivists, conservators)
- Must demonstrate track record of working under Indigenous leadership
- Required training in decolonial methodology and FPIC 2.0 protocols
- Cannot override Indigenous representatives on cultural matters
- Serve as technical advisors, not cultural authorities

**Youth delegates (20%)**:
- Elected by regional youth councils using ranked-choice voting
- Age 18-35 to bridge elder wisdom and emerging perspectives
- Prioritize youth from marginalized communities (LGBTQ+, disabled, migrant)
- Mentorship from elder knowledge keepers while maintaining independent voice
- Special focus on digital heritage and contemporary cultural innovation

**Diasporic representatives (10%)**:
- Nominated by diaspora community organizations globally
- Represent non-territorial cultural preservation needs
- Include refugees, economic migrants, and voluntary diaspora
- Bridge homeland and diaspora community cultural practices
- Focus on transnational coordination and hybrid cultural forms

**Technology advisors (advisory only)**:
- Provide technical guidance on quantum-safe archives, AI ethics, blockchain
- No voting authority—serve communities, don't make decisions for them
- Selected by technology organizations with demonstrated ethical track records
- Required training in Indigenous data sovereignty and FPIC 2.0
- Removed immediately if they undermine community control

### Decision-making protocols

**Standard decisions (75% consensus required)**:
- Allocation of Stewardship Bond resources
- Standards setting for Cultural Vitality Index
- Coordination protocols with other frameworks
- Technical infrastructure investments

**Rationale**: High consensus threshold ensures broad support and prevents majority domination. 75% requirement means Indigenous representatives (40%) + one other constituency can block problematic decisions.

**Emergency decisions (60% consensus required)**:
- Immediate responses to heritage destruction threats
- Emergency repatriation in conflict zones
- Crisis support for climate-threatened cultural sites
- Rapid response to cultural appropriation or theft

**Rationale**: Lower threshold enables faster response when heritage faces imminent threat, while still requiring substantial majority support.

**Quorum requirements**:
- Standard meetings: 70% attendance required
- Emergency sessions: 60% attendance sufficient
- Digital participation fully enabled via quantum-safe platforms

**Cultural protocols**:
- Meetings scheduled to avoid major cultural/religious observances
- Translation services for all Council languages
- Ceremony space and time integrated into meetings
- Consensus-building prioritized over voting when possible
- Dissent recorded and honored even in majority decisions

### Powers and limitations

**Resource allocation authority**:
- Manages $100M Stewardship Bonds Phase 1 (2025-2030)
- Distributes funds according to BAZ-defined priorities
- Cannot withhold funding as punishment for non-compliance
- Reports transparently via Love Ledger blockchain

**Standard-setting authority**:
- Defines Cultural Vitality Index methodology (see Monitoring & Evaluation)

### Accountability mechanisms

**Earth Council oversight**: 
- CAWC operates under Earth Council's moral authority
- Earth Council can review and overturn CAWC decisions undermining Indigenous sovereignty
- Appeals process available for BAZs disagreeing with CAWC actions

**Quarterly public reporting**:
- All decisions and resource allocations published via tapestry.org
- Love Ledger provides transparent blockchain tracking
- Community feedback integrated into next quarter's planning

**BAZ-led audits**:
- Annual evaluation by rotating BAZ audit teams
- Assess whether CAWC serves BAZ needs effectively
- Recommend structural changes based on community experience

**Whistleblower protections**:
- Council members, staff, and BAZ representatives can report concerns without retaliation
- Anonymous reporting channels available
- Independent investigation of serious allegations
- Public disclosure when appropriate

**Sunset clause**:
- Council must be reauthorized every 10 years by participating BAZs
- Reauthorization requires 70% BAZ approval
- If not reauthorized, resources transfer to BAZ control
- Enables structural evolution based on demonstrated effectiveness

## Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)

### Primary authority for cultural preservation

BAZs are **not implementation arms** of the Council—they are the primary sovereign authorities for cultural preservation, with the Council serving them.

**BAZ sovereignty includes**:
- Complete control over cultural heritage within their territories
- Authority to define what can be preserved, shared, or restricted
- Power to grant or revoke access to cultural sites and knowledge
- Final say on any digital documentation or archiving
- Absolute veto over external research or cultural projects

BAZs coordinate with the framework **voluntarily and selectively**, adopting mechanisms that serve their needs while rejecting elements that don't.

### Integrated heritage infrastructure

Rather than creating separate "heritage hubs," BAZs integrate cultural preservation into their broader governance and economic systems:

**Quantum-safe digital archives**:
- Community-controlled servers, not corporate cloud storage
- Encryption keys held by traditional knowledge succession systems
- Offline backups ensuring redundancy
- Access protocols determined by cultural authorities
- Regular security audits by BAZ-selected experts

**Living tradition schools**:
- Language immersion programs for youth
- Traditional crafts and skills transmission
- Ceremony and protocol education
- Elder-youth mentorship structures
- Integration with broader education systems

**Cultural healing centers**:
- Trauma recovery for colonial harms
- Cultural reconnection programs for displaced peoples
- Intergenerational healing circles
- Traditional healing practices alongside contemporary therapy
- Support for cultural identity development

**Cultural Innovation Labs**:
- Youth-led spaces for contemporary cultural creation
- Digital storytelling and media production
- Fusion arts blending traditional and contemporary
- Technology experimentation under community control
- Chartered as Community Work Teams earning AUBI Hearts

### FPIC 2.0 and Red Lines protection

BAZs exercise sovereignty through enhanced consent protocols:

**FPIC 2.0 requirements for any external project**:
- Free: No economic coercion (AUBI ensures basic income security)
- Prior: Consultation before project begins, with adequate deliberation time
- Informed: Complete transparency about implications and risks
- Consent: Explicit approval required, silence does not equal consent

**Red Lines Clause**: BAZs can define non-negotiable boundaries:
- Sacred knowledge that will never be shared externally
- Cultural practices that cannot be documented or observed
- Sites that remain permanently closed to outsiders
- Technologies that will not be used (e.g., certain types of AI)

**Revocation authority**: Consent can be withdrawn at any time, requiring immediate project cessation.

### Operations and sustainability

**Staff exchanges**:
- BAZs share expertise and best practices horizontally
- Cultural workers visit other BAZs to learn different approaches
- Peer mentorship rather than top-down training
- Compensation via AUBI Hearts for exchange participation

**Technology refresh cycles**:
- 5-year reviews of digital infrastructure
- BAZ approval required for any technology updates
- Community choice between technology advancement or stability
- No forced obsolescence or mandatory upgrades

**Graduation to self-sustainability**:
- BAZs develop toward economic independence from external funding
- 80% local resource capacity indicates readiness
- Community consensus determines timing, not external metrics
- Peer learning networks continue regardless of funding status

### Sovereign co-stewardship agreements

Many BAZs exist within nation-state territories, creating potential sovereignty conflicts. Sovereign Co-Stewardship Agreements provide a legal bridge:

**Agreement components**:
- Shared governance structures with clear jurisdiction delineation
- BAZ authority over cultural protocols and FPIC 2.0 processes
- Nation-state support for legal enforcement and infrastructure
- Revenue sharing from heritage-related activities (tourism, licenses)
- Dispute resolution through Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council mediation
- Escalation to Digital Justice Tribunal if mediation fails

**Example jurisdiction delineation**:
- BAZ decides what heritage can be accessed, how, and by whom
- Nation-state provides legal backing for those decisions
- BAZ receives majority of tourism/licensing revenue
- Nation-state handles external diplomatic relations
- Both parties must consent to major changes

These agreements enable BAZs to exercise cultural sovereignty **within existing nation-state structures** while working toward fuller autonomy.

## Cultural Stewardship Teams

### Specialized Community Work Teams

Cultural Stewardship Teams are organized under the **Work in Liberation Framework** as Community Work Teams, providing democratic governance, peer support, and economic viability for cultural preservation work.

**Why this matters**: Organizing as Community Work Teams means cultural workers:
- Earn AUBI Hearts for cultural preservation labor
- Access peer networks for skill-building and mutual aid
- Participate in democratic decision-making about their work
- Avoid isolation through team-based coordination
- Build collective bargaining power for resource allocation

### Team composition

**Knowledge keepers**:
- Elders holding traditional knowledge
- Language speakers teaching endangered languages
- Ceremony leaders transmitting protocols
- Traditional craftspeople sharing skills

**Artists and innovators**:
- Contemporary artists creating new cultural forms
- Digital storytellers documenting culture
- Musicians blending traditional and contemporary
- Designers adapting traditional aesthetics

**Youth participants**:
- Language learners becoming next-generation teachers
- Apprentices in traditional crafts and practices
- Digital natives bringing technological capacity
- Innovation leaders in Cultural Innovation Labs

**Ecological stewards**:
- Land managers maintaining biocultural sites
- Traditional agricultural practitioners
- Sacred site guardians
- Ecosystem restoration workers (earning both Hearts and Leaves)

### Team authority and autonomy

**Local decision-making**:
- Teams determine their own priorities and projects
- No external approval needed for team activities
- Democratic governance within teams (not hierarchical management)
- Authority to reject external funding if strings attached

**Micro-grants for marginalized groups**:
- Direct funding to women, LGBTQ+, disabled, and youth cultural workers
- Bypasses gatekeepers who might exclude marginalized voices
- Supports cultural preservation projects led by those typically underrepresented
- Accountability directly to cultural communities, not bureaucracies

**BAZ-led vetoes**:
- Teams can be overridden by broader BAZ governance if projects conflict with community values
- But teams have strong presumption of autonomy within cultural domains
- Veto power protects communities from inappropriate projects
- Teams appeal vetoes through BAZ deliberative processes

### Coordination mechanisms

**Intergenerational workshops**:
- Elder-youth paired learning
- Traditional knowledge transmission in team contexts
- Contemporary skills (digital, organizational) flowing from youth to elders
- Joint project development across generations

**Cultural exchange protocols**:
- Teams visit other BAZs to share practices
- Hosted exchanges with protocols respecting cultural sensitivity
- Documentation of exchanges for broader learning
- Compensation via AUBI Hearts for exchange time

**Peer learning networks**:
- Regional and global networks for cultural workers
- Sharing challenges, solutions, and innovations
- Collective problem-solving on common issues
- Political organizing for cultural workers' interests

## Diasporic & Digital Heritage Hubs

### Non-territorial cultural governance

Not all cultural communities are place-based. Diasporas, migrants, refugees, and digital cultures need governance structures that aren't tied to specific bioregions.

**Diasporic & Digital Heritage Hubs** provide:
- Virtual governance nodes for non-territorial communities
- Urban-based hubs for diaspora populations in cities
- Digital platforms for globally dispersed cultural groups
- Recognition that valid cultures can be transnational or digital

### Equal authority with BAZs

These Hubs operate under the **same principles** as territorial BAZs:
- Full FPIC 2.0 sovereignty over their cultural heritage
- Representation on Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council
- Eligibility for Stewardship Bond funding
- Authority to form Cultural Stewardship Teams
- Access to AUBI Hearts/Leaves rewards

**Why this matters**: Colonial displacement and economic migration have scattered many cultural communities across the globe. Requiring territorial basis for cultural sovereignty would exclude communities maintaining vibrant cultures in diaspora.

### Hub structures

**Diaspora Hubs**:
- Communities from one homeland coordinating globally
- Maintaining language, ceremony, and tradition in new contexts
- Digital platforms connecting dispersed community members
- Physical community centers in major diaspora cities
- Coordination with homeland BAZs when beneficial

**Digital culture Hubs**:
- Communities forming around digital practices and shared values
- May include open-source communities, digital artists, online movements
- Governance through digital democracy mechanisms
- Cultural production in digital-native forms
- Recognition that legitimate new cultures emerge online

**Urban Indigenous Hubs**:
- Indigenous peoples in urban contexts maintaining cultural connections
- Coordination with territorial BAZs while addressing city-specific needs
- Adaptation of traditional practices for urban environments
- Support for youth navigating Indigenous identity in cities

### Integration with territorial BAZs

Hubs and BAZs coordinate but neither controls the other:
- Diaspora Hubs may partner with homeland BAZs on specific projects
- Urban Hubs may coordinate with rural BAZs on language preservation
- Digital Hubs may provide technical support to territorial BAZs
- All relationships based on mutual consent and benefit

## Governance flowchart

**Decision flow**:
1. **Community level**: Cultural Stewardship Teams make day-to-day preservation decisions
2. **BAZ level**: BAZ governance coordinates teams, manages resources, exercises sovereignty
3. **Regional level**: Multiple BAZs coordinate on shared challenges (optional)
4. **Global level**: Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council provides coordination services (optional)

**Resource flow**:
1. **Stewardship Bonds** managed by Council
2. **Allocated to BAZs** based on needs and priorities
3. **Distributed to Teams** by BAZ governance
4. **Individuals earn Hearts** for cultural preservation work via AUBI

**Authority flow**:
1. **Sovereignty resides in communities** (not granted by external bodies)
2. **Communities delegate coordination** to BAZs (revocable)
3. **BAZs participate in Council** when beneficial (voluntary)
4. **Council serves BAZs** (not governs them)

This inverted hierarchy ensures **power flows from communities upward** through voluntary delegation, never downward through imposed authority.
