# AUBI Integration Guide: Economic Justice Through Implementation

> *"Economic security is the foundation for human dignity and community flourishing. AUBI is not just about money—it's about recognizing that care work, cultural preservation, and ecological stewardship are the true wealth of our communities."*
> — Social Resilience Council

**Purpose:** This guide ensures that all tools and methodologies within the Implementation Methods & Tools Framework integrate with and support the **[Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework](/frameworks/aubi)**. Every implementation must advance economic justice through AUBI's innovative Hearts/Leaves currency system and four-layered payout structure.

**Who Needs This Guide:**
- **Economic justice advocates** implementing AUBI pilots
- **Community organizers** integrating economic security with governance transformation
- **BAZ coordinators** implementing AUBI within bioregional governance
- **Implementation teams** connecting governance tools with economic justice

---

## **Understanding AUBI as Economic Foundation**

### **AUBI's Role in Governance Transformation**

The Adaptive Universal Basic Income Framework provides the economic foundation that enables effective governance transformation. Without economic security, communities cannot fully participate in democratic governance or engage in the care work, cultural preservation, and ecological stewardship that healthy societies require.

**AUBI Core Principles:**
- **Right Relationship Economics**: Economics based on reciprocity, care, and ecological harmony rather than extraction and competition
- **Universal Baseline Security**: Everyone deserves dignity through economic security
- **Value Recognition**: Care work, cultural preservation, and ecological stewardship are valued and compensated
- **Community Control**: Communities control economic systems rather than being controlled by them

### **The Hearts and Leaves Currency System**

AUBI introduces complementary currencies that recognize different types of value:

**Hearts Currency**: Rewards care work, community building, cultural preservation, and social contributions
- Earned through caregiving, mentorship, conflict resolution, cultural activities
- Used in care economy markets, local businesses, community services
- Stabilized by Treaty P4 reserve fund, pegged to regenerative assets

**Leaves Currency**: Non-fungible tokens for ecological restoration and environmental stewardship
- Earned through ecological restoration, environmental monitoring, sustainable practices
- Used for environmental services, green business access, ecological project funding
- Tracked through Love Ledger for transparency and verification

**Fiat Integration**: Traditional currency remains part of the system for market needs
- Universal baseline includes both fiat and Hearts (typically 70% fiat, 30% Hearts)
- Gradual transition toward more Hearts-based economy as system matures
- Maintains connection to existing economic systems during transition
