The Context Assessment Rubric serves as the entry point for communities beginning their implementation journey. Rather than prescribing universal solutions, this diagnostic tool helps communities understand their unique governance context, cultural dynamics, resource capacity, and readiness for different types of interventions. The assessment honors diverse starting points while providing practical guidance for selecting appropriate tools and implementation pathways.

## <a id="philosophy"></a>Assessment Philosophy: Assets-Based & Community-Controlled

### **Strengths-Based Approach**

Traditional assessments often focus on deficits—what communities lack or need to "fix." Our approach begins with community assets, wisdom, and existing capacity:

**🌱 Cultural Assets**: Every community possesses governance wisdom, even if not formally recognized
**🤝 Relationship Capital**: Existing networks, trust patterns, and collaboration history
**🏞️ Place-Based Knowledge**: Deep understanding of local ecosystems and resources
**📚 Learning Capacity**: Community ability to adapt, experiment, and integrate new approaches
**💪 Resilience Patterns**: How communities have navigated previous challenges and changes

### **Community Sovereignty Principles**

**👥 Community-Controlled**: Communities determine their own assessment process and timeline
**🎯 Self-Defined Goals**: Assessment explores community-identified aspirations, not external standards
**🔄 Iterative Process**: Assessment can be repeated and refined as communities evolve
**📊 Transparent Methodology**: Communities understand how recommendations are generated
**⚖️ No Judgment**: All governance contexts are valid starting points for transformation

### **Cultural Relativity & Anti-Colonial Design**

**🌍 Multiple Valid Paths**: Different governance traditions offer equally legitimate approaches
**🪶 Traditional Knowledge Honor**: Indigenous and traditional governance systems recognized as sophisticated and effective
**⚡ Rapid vs. Generational**: Both emergency response and long-term cultural change honored
**🎭 Ceremony & Ritual**: Spiritual and ceremonial governance processes included in assessment
**🗣️ Oral Traditions**: Non-written governance wisdom valued equally with formal structures
