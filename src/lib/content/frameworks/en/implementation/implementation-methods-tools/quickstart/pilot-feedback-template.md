# Pilot Feedback Template: Standardized Learning & Evaluation

> *"Every experiment teaches us something valuable, whether it succeeds spectacularly or fails gracefully. The wisdom lies in learning from both outcomes."*
> — GGF Implementation Practitioners

**Purpose:** This template provides a standardized method for communities to evaluate their pilot implementations of GGF tools and frameworks. Your feedback directly contributes to the [GGF Knowledge Commons](../monitoring-evaluation#knowledge-commons) and helps improve tools for future implementing communities.

**Use This Template When:**
- Completing a tool pilot (after 2+ weeks of testing)
- Finishing an implementation cycle (30, 60, or 90 days)
- Experiencing significant success or failure with any tool
- Ready to share cultural adaptations with other communities

**Template Language:** Available in multiple formats and languages. Request cultural adaptations at [framework-feedback@globalgovernance.org](mailto:framework-feedback@globalgovernance.org)
