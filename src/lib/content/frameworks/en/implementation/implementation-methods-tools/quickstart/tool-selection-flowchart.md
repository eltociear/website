# Tool Selection Flowchart: Finding Your Perfect Implementation Path

> *"The right tool in the right hands at the right time can transform communities. The wrong tool can create harm. Wisdom lies in choosing thoughtfully."*
> — GGF Implementation Wisdom

**Purpose:** This flowchart provides a step-by-step decision tree to help communities select the most appropriate GGF tools for their specific context, capacity, and goals. Rather than overwhelming choice, this guide creates a clear pathway to implementation success.

**How to Use:** Start at the beginning and follow the decision points based on your community's honest assessment of your situation. Each path leads to specific tool recommendations with clear reasoning.

---

## **🌟 START HERE: Your Implementation Journey Begins**

### **Step 1: What is your primary motivation?** *(Choose ONE that best fits)*

**A) CRISIS RESPONSE** → [Go to Crisis Path](#crisis-response-path)
*"We need governance coordination NOW due to emergency, conflict, or urgent threat"*

**B) STARTING NEW** → [Go to Foundation Path](#foundation-path)  
*"We want to begin governance transformation but don't know where to start"*

**C) IMPROVING EXISTING** → [Go to Enhancement Path](#enhancement-path)
*"We have some governance but want to make it more effective and inclusive"*

**D) DEEP TRANSFORMATION** → [Go to Evolution Path](#evolution-path)
*"We're ready for advanced tools and significant system change"*

**E) CONNECTING REGIONALLY** → [Go to Scaling Path](#scaling-path)
*"We want to coordinate with other communities or scale our impact"*

- [ ] **Communication Patterns**: Will it work with our communication style?
- [ ] **Time Orientation**: Does it fit our sense of appropriate pacing?

### **Practical Feasibility Check**
- [ ] **Resource Availability**: Do we have the time, people, and materials needed?
- [ ] **Skill Requirements**: Do we have or can we develop the necessary skills?
- [ ] **Technology Requirements**: Can we meet any digital or technical needs?
- [ ] **Timeline Compatibility**: Does the implementation timeline work for us?

### **Impact Potential Evaluation**
- [ ] **Clear Outcomes**: Do we understand what success looks like?
- [ ] **Community Benefit**: Will this genuinely help our community?
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Have we considered potential negative consequences?
- [ ] **Learning Opportunity**: Will this help us grow our governance capacity?

### **Support System Verification**

## **🧭 Navigation Tips & Best Practices**

### **Start Small, Dream Big**
- **Begin with one tool** rather than trying to implement multiple tools simultaneously
- **Pilot for 30-90 days** before committing to long-term implementation
- **Document your experience** using the [Pilot Feedback Template](../pilot-feedback-template)
- **Celebrate small wins** to build momentum for larger changes

### **Cultural Adaptation is Essential**
- **Every tool must be adapted** to fit your community's cultural context
- **Consult with cultural leaders** before implementing any new governance approach
- **Honor existing wisdom** and integrate traditional knowledge throughout
- **Create hybrid approaches** that blend traditional and contemporary methods

### **Build Capacity Gradually**
- **Training is investment** - dedicate time to learning before implementing
- **Develop local expertise** rather than depending on external facilitators
- **Create succession plans** so governance knowledge stays in the community
- **Practice in low-stakes situations** before using tools for major decisions

### **Connect with Peer Communities**
- **You're not alone** - thousands of communities are on similar journeys
- **Share your adaptations** to help others from similar cultural contexts
- **Learn from failures** - both yours and others' - to avoid common pitfalls
- **Celebrate successes together** to inspire continued transformation

## **🔄 Continuous Tool Selection**

### **Your Journey Doesn't End Here**

Tool selection is an ongoing process, not a one-time decision:

**Quarterly Review Questions:**
- Are our current tools still serving our community's needs?
- What new challenges have emerged that might require different tools?
- How has our capacity grown, and what new tools might we be ready for?
- What have we learned that should influence our tool choices?

**Annual Strategic Assessment:**
- Complete the [Context Assessment Rubric](../assessment-rubric) annually
- Review your [Tool Implementation Portfolio](../tools/implementation-portfolio)
- Update your [Community Governance Plan](../tools/community-governance-plan)
- Plan your next implementation cycle using lessons learned

**Evolution Triggers:**
Watch for these signs that you might be ready for more advanced tools:
- Current tools feel too simple or constraining
- Community is asking for more sophisticated approaches
- External opportunities arise (funding, partnerships, policy changes)
- Crisis or opportunities require rapid scaling or adaptation
