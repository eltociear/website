# Institution Chartering Kit
*Building Governance Institutions with Constitutional Integrity and Cultural Sovereignty*

> *"An institution is only as strong as the relationships it serves and the wisdom that guides its formation. True legitimacy flows from community consent and constitutional alignment, not external authority."*  
> — GGF Constitutional Working Group

## Tool Overview

The Institution Chartering Kit provides comprehensive guidance for creating new governance institutions that align with the **Treaty for Our Only Home** constitutional framework while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and traditional governance systems. This tool helps communities establish legally sound, culturally appropriate institutions that enhance rather than replace existing authority structures.

**Perfect for communities that are:**
- Establishing new governance bodies or councils
- Formalizing existing community organizations
- Seeking legal recognition and protection for traditional governance
- Building institutions that bridge traditional and contemporary systems
- Creating coordinating bodies between multiple communities or jurisdictions

**Constitutional Integration:** All institutions chartered using this kit automatically align with Treaty requirements for nested legitimacy, Indigenous sovereignty, and democratic participation while maintaining community autonomy and cultural protocols.

## Quick Start: Constitutional Compliance Assessment

### **Pre-Charter Assessment** ⚖️

Before beginning the chartering process, ensure your proposed institution aligns with constitutional principles:

#### **Treaty Compliance Checklist**
- [ ] **Democratic Legitimacy**: Institution serves and is accountable to affected communities
- [ ] **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Respects existing traditional governance and territorial authority
- [ ] **Nested Authority**: Operates at appropriate scale without usurping local decision-making
- [ ] **Cultural Integration**: Incorporates diverse governance traditions respectfully
- [ ] **Crisis Responsiveness**: Can coordinate with broader crisis response networks
- [ ] **Environmental Stewardship**: Includes ecological responsibilities and bioregional awareness

#### **Traditional Authority Assessment**
Critical questions to address before chartering:

**Existing Governance Evaluation:**
- What traditional governance systems already exist in this territory?
- How will this institution relate to traditional chiefs, elders, and knowledge keepers?
- Are there existing councils or assemblies that should be strengthened instead?
- What traditional protocols must be followed for legitimate institution creation?
- How will traditional law and custom be integrated into institutional operations?

**Cultural Impact Analysis:**
- Could this institution undermine traditional authority or cultural practices?
- How will traditional knowledge and sacred information be protected?
- What ceremonial or spiritual protocols are needed for institutional legitimacy?
- How will the institution support cultural preservation and language justice?

**Community Consent Verification:**
- Has Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0) been obtained from affected Indigenous communities?
- Do traditional authorities support or lead this institutional development?
- Has adequate time been given for community consultation and reflection?
- Are there unresolved conflicts that need healing before institution creation?
