# Council Convening Playbook
*Building Sacred Governance Circles with Cultural Integrity*

> *"The circle is sacred because it has no beginning and no end. When we sit in circle, we remember that every voice matters and every person carries medicine for the whole."*  
> — Elder Mary Lyons, Ojibwe Nation

## Tool Overview

The Council Convening Playbook provides step-by-step guidance for launching councils that honor Indigenous wisdom traditions while building effective governance capacity. This foundational tool helps communities establish decision-making bodies that integrate traditional protocols with contemporary coordination needs, ensuring cultural sovereignty while enabling practical governance.

**Perfect for communities that are:**
- Beginning their governance transformation journey
- Seeking to honor traditional council protocols
- Building decision-making capacity from the ground up
- Integrating diverse cultural traditions respectfully
- Establishing sustainable coordination mechanisms

## Quick Start: Your First Council Circle

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setting** (Week 1)

#### **Step 1: Assess Cultural Context** 🪶
Before convening any council, understand the cultural landscape:

**Cultural Mapping Questions:**
- What traditional governance systems exist in your community?
- Who are the recognized traditional leaders, elders, and knowledge keepers?
- What are the existing decision-making protocols and seasonal cycles?
- Are there ongoing conflicts or healing needs that must be addressed?
- What languages should be prioritized for inclusive participation?

**Cultural Protection Checklist:**
- [ ] Consult with traditional knowledge keepers before beginning
- [ ] Identify any cultural protocols that must be followed
- [ ] Assess whether existing traditional councils should be strengthened instead
- [ ] Ensure new council structures complement rather than compete with traditional governance
- [ ] Plan for ceremony and spiritual elements as culturally appropriate

#### **Step 2: Define Purpose & Scope** 🎯
Establish clear intentions for your council:

**Purpose Definition Template:**
```
Our council exists to: [Primary governance function]
Our council serves: [Community definition and boundaries]
Our council operates by: [Core values and principles]
Our council coordinates with: [Existing authority structures]
Our council honors: [Cultural traditions and protocols]
```

**Common Council Types:**
- **Community Circle**: General community decision-making and coordination
- **Bioregional Council**: Cross-community coordination for ecological stewardship  
- **Crisis Response Council**: Emergency coordination and rapid decision-making
- **Youth Council**: Next-generation leadership and long-term perspective
- **Elder Council**: Traditional knowledge guidance and cultural preservation
- **Healing Circle**: Community reconciliation and conflict transformation

#### **Step 3: Identify Initial Participants** 👥

2. Community nomination processes for broader representation
3. Self-selection opportunities for those feeling called to serve
4. Elder blessing and traditional authority approval where appropriate

### **Phase 2: Initial Convening** (Week 2)

#### **Step 4: Sacred Space Preparation** 🕊️
Create container for meaningful work:

**Physical Space Setup:**

|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Decision-Making** | Consensus process, conflict resolution, emergency protocols | Traditional decision-making authority, elder consultation, sacred timing |
| **Communication** | Speaking protocols, listening practices, confidentiality | Traditional speaking orders, ceremonial silence, language justice |
| **Participation** | Attendance expectations, role definitions, accountability | Traditional responsibilities, seasonal obligations, family priorities |
| **Cultural Protocol** | Ceremony integration, traditional authority respect, knowledge protection | Sacred knowledge safeguards, appropriate sharing, cultural attribution |
| **Time & Rhythm** | Meeting frequency, seasonal considerations, emergency activation | Traditional calendars, ceremonial cycles, natural rhythms |

**Decision-Making Protocol Template:**
```
Our council makes decisions by:

3. Consensus-building through multiple rounds of discussion
4. Cultural protocol integration at each stage
