# AUBI Pilot Program Guide
*Launching Abundant Universal Basic Income with Hearts, Leaves, and Right Relationship*

> *"True abundance flows not from accumulation but from relationship—with each other, with the land, and with the sacred reciprocity that sustains all life. AUBI honors the wealth that already exists in our communities while creating new pathways for care and regeneration to flourish."*  
> — Social Resilience Council, Indigenous Economic Wisdom Collaborative

## Tool Overview

The AUBI Pilot Program Guide provides comprehensive methodology for launching Adaptive Universal Basic Income systems that integrate traditional Indigenous economics with contemporary abundance technologies. This tool enables communities to pilot the Hearts and Leaves currency system while building capacity for regenerative economics based on Right Relationship rather than extraction.

**Essential for communities that are:**
- Transitioning from scarcity-based to abundance-based economic models
- Integrating care work, cultural preservation, and ecological stewardship into economic recognition
- Building community wealth and economic sovereignty through cooperative models
- Piloting Hearts and Leaves currency systems with Love Ledger technology
- Creating economic systems that serve seven-generation thinking and community wellbeing

**Right Relationship Foundation:** AUBI operates on the principle of Right Relationship—balanced, regenerative connections between individuals, communities, and the planet. Traditional Indigenous gift economies provide the wisdom foundation for contemporary abundance technologies.

## Foundation Principles: Economics as Sacred Relationship

### **Indigenous Economic Wisdom Integration** 🪶

#### **Traditional Economy Recognition**
AUBI builds on Indigenous economic wisdom that recognizes abundance through relationship:

**Traditional Economic Principles:**
```
RIGHT RELATIONSHIP ECONOMICS:
□ Abundance flows from healthy relationships rather than individual accumulation
□ Care work, cultural preservation, and ecological stewardship are the foundation of true wealth
□ Economic systems serve community wellbeing and seven-generation sustainability
□ Gift economies and reciprocity create stronger communities than market competition
□ Traditional knowledge and cultural practices are valuable contributions to community wealth

TRADITIONAL WEALTH CONCEPTS:
□ Relational wealth through kinship, community connection, and cultural participation
□ Ecological wealth through traditional stewardship and sustainable resource management
□ Cultural wealth through language preservation, traditional knowledge transmission, and spiritual practice
□ Community wealth through mutual aid, traditional governance, and collective care
□ Spiritual wealth through ceremony, traditional teaching, and sacred relationship maintenance
```
