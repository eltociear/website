# Citizen Assembly Module
*Building Deliberative Democracy with Indigenous Co-Governance and Traditional Wisdom*

> *"When people gather in sacred circle with good intention, the wisdom that emerges belongs not to any individual but to the whole community. The circle teaches us that every voice carries medicine for our collective healing."*  
> — Traditional Knowledge from the Council of All Beings

## Tool Overview

The Citizen Assembly Module provides comprehensive methodology for establishing deliberative democracy processes that integrate traditional Indigenous governance with contemporary participatory decision-making. This tool enables communities to harness collective wisdom for complex decisions while maintaining cultural protocols and ensuring all voices are heard and valued.

**Essential for communities that are:**
- Moving beyond representative democracy to direct community participation

**Indigenous Co-Governance Integration:** All citizen assemblies operate under Indigenous co-governance principles, with traditional knowledge keepers and Indigenous representatives holding equal authority to non-Indigenous participants. Traditional consensus and cultural protocols guide all assembly processes.
