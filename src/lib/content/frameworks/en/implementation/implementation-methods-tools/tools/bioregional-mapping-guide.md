# Bioregional Mapping Guide
*Defining Governance Territories Through Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Natural Boundaries*

> *"The land is not something you own, it's something you belong to. The boundaries of true governance follow the paths of water, the migrations of our relatives, and the sacred places where our ancestors made covenant with the Earth."*  
> — Elder Sarah James, Gwich'in Nation

## Tool Overview

The Bioregional Mapping Guide provides comprehensive methodology for defining governance territories based on ecological relationships, traditional territories, and natural systems rather than colonial administrative boundaries. This tool centers Traditional Ecological Knowledge while integrating contemporary mapping technologies to support Indigenous sovereignty and bioregional coordination.

**Essential for communities that are:**
- Establishing Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) based on natural boundaries
- Reclaiming traditional territorial governance and ecological stewardship
- Coordinating governance across watersheds and ecosystems
- Defining jurisdiction for community-controlled resource management
- Building inter-community coordination around shared ecological systems

**Traditional Knowledge Priority:** This mapping process is led by Traditional Ecological Knowledge, with contemporary technologies serving Indigenous knowledge rather than replacing it. All mapping respects Indigenous territorial sovereignty and sacred site protection protocols.

## Foundation Principles: Land as Teacher

### **Traditional Territory as Foundation** 🪶

#### **Indigenous Sovereignty Recognition**
Before any bioregional mapping begins, acknowledge and respect Indigenous territorial authority:

**Territorial Authority Assessment:**
```
INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY MAPPING:
□ Which Indigenous nations have traditional territory in this bioregion?
□ What are the traditional boundaries and territorial relationships?
□ What treaties, agreements, or legal recognitions exist for traditional territories?
□ Which Indigenous communities maintain active territorial stewardship?
□ What traditional governance systems operate in this territory?

TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE PROTOCOLS:
□ What Traditional Ecological Knowledge exists about bioregional boundaries?
□ What seasonal rounds and traditional calendars define territorial relationships?
□ What migration routes, gathering areas, and sacred sites define bioregional connections?
□ What traditional resource management systems operate across this territory?
□ What cultural protocols govern territorial access and resource sharing?
```

#### **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)**
All bioregional mapping must obtain proper consent from Indigenous communities:

**FPIC Implementation Checklist:**
