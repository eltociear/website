## <a id="stack-overview"></a>Stack Overview & Philosophy: Building Strong Foundations

### **Who This Stack Serves**

**Primary Audiences**:
- **New Community Organizations**: Groups forming around shared values or community challenges
- **Grassroots Movements**: Social justice and environmental movements developing governance capacity
- **Traditional Communities**: Indigenous and traditional communities exploring contemporary governance integration
- **Intentional Communities**: Ecovillages, cohousing, and other planned communities developing governance systems

- Organizations with sophisticated governance seeking enhancement (use Building Capacity Stack)
- Communities with significant internal conflicts (address healing first)

### **Stack Philosophy: Relationship-Centered Foundation Building**

#### **Building on Existing Strengths**

**Asset-Based Approach**:
Rather than focusing on what communities lack, the Getting Started Stack begins with existing assets:

- **Traditional Practice Honor**: Enhancing existing cultural practices rather than imposing external models
- **Informal Network Recognition**: Formalizing existing informal leadership and decision-making
- **Community Rhythm Respect**: Adapting tools to existing community meeting and decision rhythms
- **Value Alignment**: Ensuring governance tools support rather than conflict with community values

#### **Gradual Capacity Building**

**Step-by-Step Development**:
The stack uses a gradual progression from simple to complex:
