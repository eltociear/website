Cultural adaptation represents the sacred heart of ethical implementation—the recognition that governance tools must honor and strengthen cultural traditions rather than replacing or undermining them. These protocols ensure that every tool, methodology, and framework within the GGF actively supports decolonization, cultural revitalization, and Indigenous sovereignty while preventing the perpetuation of colonial patterns that have caused immense harm to communities worldwide.

## <a id="anti-colonial-framework"></a>Anti-Colonial Framework & Evaluation: Preventing Harm, Building Liberation

### **The Anti-Colonial Imperative: Beyond "Do No Harm" to Active Liberation**

Anti-colonial design goes far beyond avoiding cultural insensitivity—it requires actively dismantling systems of oppression while building governance approaches that heal historical trauma and support cultural renaissance. Every tool and methodology must undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure it contributes to rather than detracts from liberation movements worldwide.

#### **Historical Analysis & Pattern Recognition**

**Colonial Governance Pattern Identification**:
- **Imposed Authority Structures**: Tools that concentrate power in external experts or impose unfamiliar decision-making processes
- **Cultural Replacement**: Methodologies that position themselves as superior to traditional governance practices
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Approaches that learn from communities without providing equal benefit or recognition
- **Economic Dependency**: Tools that require ongoing external resources or create dependency on outside institutions
- **Temporal Colonization**: Implementation timelines that ignore seasonal cycles, ceremonial calendars, or traditional decision-making processes

**Historical Trauma Recognition**:
- **Governance Trauma**: Understanding how colonial governance imposition affected community trust in formal institutions
- **Cultural Suppression**: Recognizing how traditional practices were criminalized or pathologized by colonial systems
- **Economic Disruption**: Acknowledging how traditional economic systems were disrupted by capitalist extraction
- **Spiritual Persecution**: Understanding how ceremonial and spiritual practices were suppressed or appropriated
- **Language Suppression**: Recognizing how Indigenous languages were criminalized and how this affects contemporary governance capacity

#### **Power Dynamics Analysis & Redistribution**

**Current Power Structure Assessment**:
- **Resource Control**: Who currently controls funding, land, and material resources in implementation contexts?
- **Decision-Making Authority**: Who has real power to determine implementation approaches, timelines, and adaptations?
- **Knowledge Authority**: Whose knowledge systems are valued and whose are marginalized in implementation processes?
- **Representation**: Who speaks for communities in external relationships and funding negotiations?
- **Benefits Distribution**: Who benefits materially and socially from governance tool implementation?

**Power Redistribution Protocols**:
- **Community Resource Control**: Transfer material resource control to communities rather than maintaining external oversight
- **Traditional Authority Recognition**: Traditional leaders have equal or superior authority to academic experts or external facilitators
- **Knowledge System Equality**: Traditional knowledge systems recognized as equally sophisticated and valid as Western academic knowledge
- **Community Spokesperson Authority**: Communities control who represents them in external relationships rather than external organizations choosing community representatives
- **Benefit Sharing**: Economic and social benefits from implementation flow primarily to implementing communities rather than external organizations

### **Comprehensive Anti-Colonial Evaluation Template**
