# Anti-Colonial Evaluation Template
*Systematic Assessment for Decolonization and Cultural Integrity*

> *"Decolonization is not a metaphor. It requires the repatriation of Indigenous land and life. Any framework, tool, or system that does not actively advance Indigenous sovereignty is complicit in the continuation of colonial violence."*  
> — Tuck & Yang, "Decolonization is Not a Metaphor"

## Template Overview

The Anti-Colonial Evaluation Template provides systematic methodology for assessing whether governance tools, frameworks, and institutions genuinely serve decolonization or inadvertently reproduce colonial patterns of domination. This template ensures that all GGF implementations strengthen Indigenous sovereignty, traditional governance, and cultural integrity rather than co-opting Indigenous wisdom for settler benefit.

**Essential for evaluating:**
- All GGF tools and frameworks before implementation
- Existing governance institutions and systems seeking decolonization
- Partnerships and collaborations involving Indigenous communities
- Technology and economic systems affecting traditional territories
- Any initiative claiming to serve Indigenous communities or traditional knowledge

**Foundational Principle:** True decolonization requires the dismantling of colonial structures and the restoration of Indigenous sovereignty over traditional territories, governance systems, and cultural knowledge. This template measures progress toward these fundamental transformations.
