# Resource Requirement Calculator
*Estimating Personnel, Time, and Funding for GGF Implementation*

> *"True abundance comes from understanding what we need, what we have, and what we can share. This calculator honors traditional reciprocity while enabling contemporary coordination."*  
> — Community Resource Planning Council

## Calculator Overview

The Resource Requirement Calculator provides systematic methodology for estimating human, financial, and material resources needed for implementing GGF tools and frameworks. This calculator integrates traditional resource sharing with contemporary funding while supporting community economic sovereignty and Hearts/Leaves economic systems.

**Essential for planning:**
- Individual GGF tool implementation resource requirements
- Complete tool stack implementation across implementation journeys
- AUBI pilot program resource coordination and funding
- Multi-community bioregional coordination resource sharing
- Long-term sustainability and community economic development

**Resource Sovereignty Principle:** All resource calculations support community control over economic systems and traditional resource sharing while enabling access to contemporary funding and support systems.
