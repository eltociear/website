# Glossary of Implementation Terms
*Definitions for Global Governance Framework Implementation*

> *"Words carry the spirit of our intentions. How we define concepts shapes how we relate to each other and the world. These definitions honor traditional wisdom while building bridges for contemporary coordination."*  
> — Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council

## Purpose and Approach

This glossary provides definitions for terms used throughout the Implementation Methods & Tools Framework and broader Global Governance Framework. Definitions prioritize Indigenous concepts and traditional knowledge while ensuring accessibility for diverse communities implementing GGF tools.

**Guiding Principles for Definitions:**
- **Indigenous Wisdom First**: Traditional knowledge and Indigenous concepts lead definitions
- **Cultural Respect**: No appropriation or misrepresentation of sacred or protected knowledge
- **Living Language**: Definitions evolve through community input and traditional guidance
- **Accessibility**: Clear explanations without academic jargon or colonial terminology
- **Multiple Traditions**: Recognition of diverse cultural understandings of concepts
