# Oceans & Marine Governance Framework
## At a Glance

> *"The ocean is the Blue Heart of the Planet—a sacred, living covenant that circulates life, regulates climate, and connects all beings in a web of interdependence."*

---

### 🌊 **The Vision**
**By 2050**: Thriving marine ecosystems with legal rights, Indigenous-led governance, and a regenerative blue economy that works in harmony with ecological limits. The ocean as the Blue Heart of our planet—protected, restored, and revered.

---

### 🎯 **Core Mission**
Transform humanity's relationship with the ocean from exploitation to stewardship through **rights-based governance**, **Indigenous leadership**, and **regenerative economics**.

---

### 📊 **The Crisis We Address**
- **Ocean warming** at 0.33°C per decade triggering mass coral bleaching
- **30% increase** in ocean acidification since Industrial Revolution
- **8 million tons** of plastic entering oceans annually
- **90% of large predatory fish** populations gone since 1950
- **Fragmented governance** unable to address interconnected marine threats

### ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How does this respect national sovereignty?**
**A:** Framework operates within existing UNCLOS law, providing coordination support rather than governance replacement. Nations maintain full control over territorial waters while gaining access to funding, technology, and cooperation benefits.

**Q: Is the $300M budget feasible?**
**A:** Yes—represents just 1.4% of current $22B in harmful fishing subsidies. Economic modeling shows 6:1 returns through ecosystem services, with Costa Rica demonstrating economic growth from eliminating harmful subsidies.

**Q: How do you prevent corporate capture?**
**A:** Indigenous veto power, limited corporate representation (10% voting), transparent blockchain funding, community oversight, and diverse funding sources prevent any single entity from controlling the framework.

**Q: What about communities lacking technology?**
**A:** Framework includes low-tech participation pathways (radio reporting, paper monitoring, community coordinators) with equal weighting of all contributions regardless of technology access.
