# Quick Start Guide

*Your First Steps Toward a Bioregional Autonomous Zone*

---

The path to a thriving BAZ may seem overwhelming when you first encounter the full framework. Where do you begin? How do you move from inspiration to action without getting lost in the complexity? This Quick Start Guide offers a simplified entry point for communities ready to take their first concrete steps.

## The Reality Check: Start Where You Are

Before diving into any framework, take an honest assessment of where your community stands today:

- **Do you have 5-10 people genuinely committed to this journey?** Not just interested, but willing to invest time and energy over months and years.
- **Can you dedicate 3-6 months to foundational work** before expecting to see major changes?
- **Do you have access to $2,000-5,000** for initial expenses like workshops, legal consultation, and basic infrastructure?
- **Are you prepared for this to be messy, nonlinear, and full of learning curves?**

If you answered "yes" to most of these questions, you're ready to begin. If not, spend time building your core group and resources before proceeding.

## The Six-Month Foundation: Your Minimum Viable Beginning

Rather than tackling all six pillars at once, focus on these three essential elements that will create the foundation for everything else:

### **Months 1-2: Spark the Vision (Pillar 1)**

**What You'll Do:**
- Form a Convening Circle of 5-10 diverse community members
- Host your first Community Dialogue to explore shared dreams and values
- Draft a simple Shared Vision Statement that captures your collective aspiration

**What You'll Need:**
- **People:** 5-10 committed individuals willing to meet regularly
- **Resources:** $200-500 for meeting space, materials, and light refreshments
- **Time:** 2-4 community gatherings, plus working sessions for the core circle

**Your Quick Win:** A clear, inspiring vision statement that 80% of your group can enthusiastically support.

**Sample Vision Statement:** *"We are a community that restores the health of our watershed while creating an economy that values care for each other and the earth, so that our children inherit a world of abundance and beauty."*

### **Months 2-4: Map Your Place (Pillar 2)**

**What You'll Do:**
- Create a basic map of your watershed and bioregion
- Research and honor Indigenous territories through respectful outreach
- Define your initial "zone of influence"—the geographic area you'll focus on first

**What You'll Need:**
- **People:** 3-5 community members interested in ecology and mapping
- **Resources:** $500-1,500 for mapping software, consultation fees, and workshop materials
- **Time:** 4-6 mapping workshops, plus research and consultation time

**Your Quick Win:** A simple but accurate map showing your watershed boundaries, key ecological features, and cultural landmarks.

**Pro Tip:** Start with free tools like Google Earth and local watershed maps from your government. You don't need expensive GIS software to begin.

### **Months 4-6: Start Small (Pillar 6)**

**What You'll Do:**
- Launch your first pilot project (community garden, tool library, skill-sharing network)
- Test AUBI Layer 1 payments with 5-10 volunteer households
- Create a simple community treasury to track shared resources

**What You'll Need:**
- **People:** Your full founding group, plus interested community members
- **Resources:** $1,000-5,000 for pilot project and initial AUBI payments
- **Time:** Weekly project meetings, monthly community gatherings, ongoing coordination

**Your Quick Win:** Demonstrable proof that your vision can translate into tangible action that improves people's lives.

**Sample Pilot Projects:**
- **Community Food Hub:** Bulk buying, food preservation workshops, seed swaps
- **Care Network:** Child care co-op, elder support, skill sharing
- **Restoration Project:** Stream cleanup, native plant propagation, habitat restoration

## The Three Essential Toolkits

To support these first critical months, you'll need three core resources:

### **1. Community Dialogue Kit**
- Facilitator questions for visioning sessions
- Icebreaker exercises that build trust
- Templates for recording and synthesizing community input
- Conflict navigation tools for when conversations get difficult

### **2. Bioregional Mapping for Beginners**
- Step-by-step guide to watershed identification
- Protocols for respectful Indigenous consultation
- Simple GIS tools and tutorials
- Cultural mapping techniques for honoring place-based knowledge

### **3. First 100 Days with AUBI**
- Treasury setup templates and accounting basics
- Sample payment structures for different community sizes
- Legal compliance guidelines for alternative currencies
- Troubleshooting guide for common implementation challenges

## Your Six-Month Milestones

By the end of your initial six months, you should be able to point to:

1. **A shared vision** that 80%+ of your core group actively supports
2. **A clear sense of place** with defined bioregional boundaries and key relationships
3. **At least one successful pilot project** that demonstrates your values in action
4. **Basic AUBI payments** flowing to 5-10 households, even if small
5. **Growing community engagement** with 20-30 people regularly participating
6. **Documentation of your journey** through photos, stories, and lessons learned

## After the Quick Start: Your Next Steps

Once you've completed these foundational elements, you'll be ready to engage with the full BAZ formation process:

- **Months 7-12:** Tackle Pillar 3 (Legal & Institutional Scaffolding) to create formal structures
- **Year 2:** Develop Pillar 4 (Governance Formation) with citizen assemblies and decision-making protocols  
- **Years 2-3:** Integrate Pillar 5 (GGF Framework Integration) to connect with the broader movement
- **Years 3-5:** Mature your Pillar 6 (Economic Sovereignty) systems and expand to serve more households

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Even with the best intentions, many community formation efforts stumble. Here are the most common traps and how to avoid them:

**The Planning Trap:** Spending months perfecting your vision without taking any concrete action. *Solution:* Set a firm deadline for moving from planning to pilot projects.

**The Perfectionism Trap:** Waiting until you have everything figured out before beginning. *Solution:* Embrace "good enough" solutions that you can improve through iteration.

**The Founder's Syndrome:** Having one or two people do all the work while others remain passive. *Solution:* Deliberately distribute leadership from day one.

**The Scale Trap:** Trying to do too much too fast and burning out your core group. *Solution:* Focus on small wins that build confidence and momentum.

**The Isolation Trap:** Thinking you have to figure everything out alone. *Solution:* Connect with other BAZ communities and the broader GGF network from the beginning.

## Ready to Begin?

The world doesn't need another perfect plan—it needs communities willing to start where they are, with what they have, and learn as they go. Your bioregion is calling for stewards who will tend its health and nurture its potential. The question is not whether you're ready, but whether you're willing to begin.

*Remember: Every journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Every thriving bioregion begins with a single conversation. What conversation will you host?*
