# Pre-Formation Assessment

*Before You Begin: Honest Evaluation of Your Readiness*

---

The dream of creating a regenerative community is compelling, but dreams alone don't create thriving BAZs. Before diving into the six pillars, take time for an honest assessment of your starting conditions. This isn't about discouraging aspiring communities—it's about setting realistic expectations and identifying the foundational work needed for success.

Think of this assessment as a pre-flight check. Pilots don't skip safety checks because they're eager to fly; they do them precisely because flying matters too much to leave to chance. Your BAZ matters too much to launch without understanding your actual capacity and constraints.

## The Four Assessment Domains

### **Domain 1: Human Capital & Community Cohesion**
*Do you have the people and relationships to sustain this work?*

The most beautiful vision in the world will fail without sufficient human commitment and social cohesion. This domain assesses whether you have the interpersonal foundation necessary for the challenging work ahead.

#### **Core Group Assessment**

**Essential Question:** Do you have a critical mass of genuinely committed people?

**Minimum Thresholds:**
- **Micro-BAZ (Homestead):** 3-5 adults willing to commit 10+ hours/week for 2+ years
- **Meso-BAZ (Village):** 8-12 adults willing to commit 5-10 hours/week for 3+ years  
- **Macro-BAZ (Bioregional):** 15-25 adults willing to commit 5+ hours/week for 5+ years

**Assessment Questions:**
- How many people have attended 80%+ of organizing meetings over the past 3 months?
- Who has contributed significant unpaid time or resources to preparatory work?
- If you asked for a $500 commitment from each member tomorrow, how many would say yes immediately?
- Who would continue this work even if the most charismatic leaders left?

**Red Flags:**
- One or two people doing 80%+ of the organizing work
- High meeting attendance but low follow-through on commitments
- People joining for what they can get rather than what they can contribute
- Significant enthusiasm but unwillingness to commit specific time or resources

#### **Social Cohesion Assessment**

**Essential Question:** Can this group navigate conflict and make decisions together?

Use this **Community Cohesion Assessment Toolkit**:

**Relationship Quality Survey** (anonymous, for all potential members):
- "I trust most people in this group to follow through on commitments" (1-5 scale)
- "I feel comfortable expressing disagreement in group meetings" (1-5 scale)  
- "I believe this group can handle significant conflicts without fragmenting" (1-5 scale)
- "I would be willing to live near most people in this group" (1-5 scale)

**Conflict Navigation Test:**
- Has the group successfully navigated at least one significant disagreement?
- Are there unresolved interpersonal tensions that people avoid discussing?
- Does decision-making typically involve genuine dialogue or just one perspective dominating?

**Diversity & Inclusion Assessment:**
- Does the group reflect the demographics of your broader community?
- Are there meaningful leadership roles for people from different backgrounds?
- Do meeting formats and decision-making styles work for people with different communication preferences?

**Scoring Your Social Cohesion:**
- **Green (Ready):** Average survey scores >4.0, successful conflict resolution, meaningful diversity
- **Yellow (Needs Work):** Average scores 3.0-4.0, some tensions but willingness to address them
- **Red (Not Ready):** Average scores <3.0, unresolved major conflicts, homogeneous leadership

### **Domain 2: Financial Viability & Economic Reality**
*Can you afford to do this work, and do you understand the economic transition?*

Many community formation efforts fail due to financial unrealism. This domain helps you understand both the costs of BAZ formation and the economic transition challenges you'll face.

#### **Financial Runway Calculator**

The bridge from a fiat-dependent economy to a regenerative one takes time. Use this spreadsheet template to model your community's financial transition:

**Monthly Fiat Obligations (Per Household):**
- Housing (mortgage/rent, property taxes, insurance)
- Utilities (electricity, gas, water, internet, phone)
- Transportation (car payments, insurance, fuel, maintenance)
- Healthcare (insurance premiums, medications, regular care)
- Food (grocery bills, eating out)
- Debt service (credit cards, student loans, personal loans)
- Other fixed expenses (childcare, subscriptions, etc.)

**Monthly Fiat Income Sources:**
- Employment income (after taxes)
- Investment income, social benefits, family support
- Potential AUBI Layer 1 payments (conservative estimates)
- Estimated savings from community sharing (conservative)

**Financial Runway Assessment:**
- **Total Monthly Fiat Gap:** Obligations minus income per household
- **Community Aggregate Gap:** Individual gaps multiplied by number of households
- **Months of Savings Available:** Current savings divided by monthly gap
- **Break-Even Timeline:** When local production/AUBI could close the gap

**Sample Calculation:**
*Family of 4 in rural area:*
- Monthly fiat obligations: $3,200
- Employment income: $2,400  
- Potential AUBI: $400 (2 adults × $200)
- Community savings: $200 (shared meals, childcare, etc.)
- **Monthly gap: $200**
- Current savings: $8,000
- **Financial runway: 40 months**

**Assessment Outcomes:**
- **Green:** 24+ months runway for 80%+ of member households
- **Yellow:** 12-24 months runway, but with clear plan to extend or reduce costs
- **Red:** <12 months runway or unwillingness to share financial information

## Comprehensive Assessment Scoring

After completing all four domains, use this matrix to evaluate your overall readiness:

### **Readiness Levels:**

**GREEN - Ready to Begin (3+ domains green, 0 red domains):**
You have strong foundations across most areas and can confidently begin BAZ formation. Focus on addressing any yellow areas during your first spiral through the pillars.

**YELLOW - Needs Preparation (2+ domains yellow, <2 red domains):**
You have significant strengths but need focused work in several areas before beginning full BAZ formation. Consider a 6-12 month preparation period to address gaps.

**RED - Foundation Building Required (2+ domains red):**
You need substantial foundational work before attempting BAZ formation. This isn't failure—it's valuable information that can save you from costly mistakes. Focus on building your base for 1-2 years before reassessing.

### **Domain Prioritization Guide**

**If Domain 1 (Human Capital) is red:** Focus exclusively on community building and relationship development. Nothing else matters without sufficient committed people and social cohesion.

**If Domain 2 (Financial) is red:** Develop member economic stability and community fundraising capacity before proceeding with formation activities that require significant resources.

**If Domain 3 (Skills) is red:** Invest heavily in education, training, and relationship building with experienced practitioners and service providers.

**If Domain 4 (Legal) is red:** Consider relocating to a more favorable jurisdiction, building political support for policy changes, or scaling down your initial ambitions.

## Pre-Assessment Preparation: The Assessment Working Group

Don't attempt this assessment alone. Form a small **Assessment Working Group** of 3-5 people who can coordinate the evaluation process and ensure honest, comprehensive analysis.

**Working Group Responsibilities:**
- Design and distribute surveys and assessment tools
- Coordinate individual and small group assessment activities  
- Synthesize results and identify patterns across domains
- Facilitate community discussion of findings and implications
- Develop recommendations for addressing gaps and building on strengths

**Assessment Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Working group formation and tool preparation
- **Weeks 2-3:** Individual assessments and data gathering
- **Week 4:** Small group discussions and synthesis
- **Week 5:** Community presentation and strategic planning
- **Week 6:** Final assessment report and next steps planning

## Moving Forward: From Assessment to Action

### **If You're Ready (Green Assessment)**

Celebrate your strong foundation and move confidently into the BAZ Starter Pack or full six-pillar process. Use your assessment results to:
- Leverage your strengths in early pillar work
- Address yellow-zone areas proactively  
- Build on existing relationships and capabilities
- Set realistic timelines based on actual capacity

### **If You Need Preparation (Yellow Assessment)**

Create a focused preparation plan addressing your specific gaps:
- Prioritize the most critical deficits for your context
- Set specific timelines for improvement (typically 6-18 months)
- Identify resources and support for capability building
- Plan regular reassessment to track progress

### **If You Need Foundation Building (Red Assessment)**

Step back from BAZ formation timeline and focus on fundamental development:
- Address red-zone domains systematically
- Consider starting with smaller community projects to build capacity
- Connect with mentors and experienced communities for guidance
- Plan for 1-3 years of foundational work before reassessing

## The Value of Honest Assessment

It's natural to want to skip this assessment and dive into the exciting work of community formation. But communities that begin with clear understanding of their actual capacity are far more likely to succeed than those that operate on hope and assumptions.

Remember: **This assessment is not a judgment of your worthiness—it's a tool for your success.** Every thriving community began somewhere, and many started with significant gaps in multiple domains. The difference between communities that succeed and those that struggle is often not where they started, but whether they honestly assessed their starting point and planned accordingly.

Your assessment results are not permanent. Capabilities can be developed, resources can be raised, relationships can be built, and legal environments can be changed. What matters is that you see clearly where you are now, so you can chart the most effective path to where you want to go.

**The question is not whether you're ready—it's whether you're willing to discover what readiness requires and do the work to get there.**

Your bioregion is worth that level of preparation. Your community deserves that kind of foundation.

*"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." - Benjamin Franklin*

*"In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." - Dwight D. Eisenhower*

Both quotes are true. Prepare thoughtfully, then adapt creatively. Your assessment is your preparation. Your BAZ formation is your adaptation.

**Begin with clarity. Build with wisdom. Adapt with courage.**
