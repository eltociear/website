# Pillar 6: Igniting the Engine - Economic Sovereignty

*Activating a Regenerative Economy That Rewards Care*

---

*Maria feels a deep satisfaction as she logs her storytelling circle into the Love Ledger, earning Hearts for the cultural preservation work that feeds her community's soul. Tomorrow she'll join the watershed restoration team, earning Leaves for the ecological healing that feeds the land's needs. Her neighbor Chen earns Hearts for caring for elders, while young Alejandro earns both Hearts and Leaves for teaching permaculture to children. For the first time in their lives, their most meaningful work—caring for each other and the earth—is also their most economically valuable work. The engine of their regenerative economy hums with the rhythm of life itself.*

## Beyond Scarcity: The Economics of Regeneration

Most of us have grown up in economic systems that assume scarcity, competition, and endless growth on a finite planet. These systems reward extraction, exploitation, and accumulation while treating care work, ecological stewardship, and community building as economically invisible or worthless.

The result is a world of profound abundance in technological capacity and material wealth existing alongside devastating scarcity in care, connection, ecological health, and meaning. We have optimized our economic systems to produce things we don't need while failing to support the work that makes life worth living.

Pillar 6 is about "Igniting the Engine" of a fundamentally different kind of economy—one that recognizes and rewards the work that actually sustains life. This regenerative economy measures success not by GDP growth but by ecological health, community well-being, and the flourishing of all life forms.

This economic transformation is not just about changing currencies or payment systems—it's about recognizing different forms of value, organizing work around purpose rather than profit, and creating economic relationships that strengthen rather than exploit communities and ecosystems.

The "engine" metaphor is intentional: like any engine, a regenerative economy requires multiple interconnected systems working together to convert inputs into motion toward your desired outcomes. But unlike extractive economies that burn through resources and relationships, regenerative economies create more value than they consume, healing damage while meeting needs.

## The Architecture of Regenerative Economics

Your BAZ's economic system operates on three interconnected levels, each serving different functions but all working together to create economic resilience and regenerative impact.

### **The Three-Layered Economic System**

**Layer 1: Fiat Currency Interface**
Your community continues to interface with the broader economy through national currencies for taxes, external obligations, and trade relationships that require conventional money.

*Functions:* Legal compliance, external trade, transition bridge, emergency reserves
*Management:* Community treasury, transparent accounting, democratic oversight
*Proportion:* Initially 70-80% of economic activity, decreasing over time as internal systems mature

**Layer 2: Hearts Currency - The Care Economy**
Hearts recognize and reward care work, cultural activities, education, conflict resolution, and other activities that strengthen community social fabric and well-being.

*Functions:* Care work validation, community building incentives, social cohesion measurement
*Value Backing:* Community well-being metrics, cultural vitality measures, social health indicators
*Distribution:* AUBI Layer 2 payments, community work team compensation, peer recognition systems

**Layer 3: Leaves Currency - The Ecological Economy**
Leaves recognize and reward ecological restoration, sustainable production, environmental stewardship, and activities that enhance the health of your bioregion.

*Functions:* Ecological work incentives, environmental impact measurement, regenerative activity validation
*Value Backing:* Ecological health metrics, restoration outcomes, sustainability assessments
*Distribution:* Verified ecological work, restoration project completion, sustainable production activities

### **The Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) System**

AUBI provides the economic security that enables people to engage in meaningful work rather than just survival jobs, while creating incentive structures that align individual and community well-being with ecological health.

**AUBI Layer 1: Basic Security (Fiat Currency)**
Unconditional payments in national currency that cover basic living expenses—housing, food, healthcare, and other necessities.

*Coverage:* 80-100% of basic living expenses for all community members
*Funding:* Community treasury, external income, grants, community enterprises
*Distribution:* Equal payments to all community members regardless of contribution level

**AUBI Layer 2: Purpose Incentives (Hearts Currency)**
Payments in Hearts currency for engaging in care work, cultural activities, education, and other community-building activities.

*Coverage:* Variable payments based on community contribution and need
*Funding:* Community work validation, peer recognition, cultural activity participation
*Distribution:* Merit-based payments for verified community contributions

**AUBI Layer 3: Regeneration Rewards (Leaves Currency)**
Payments in Leaves currency for ecological restoration, sustainable production, environmental stewardship, and other regenerative activities.

*Coverage:* Variable payments based on ecological impact and restoration outcomes
*Funding:* Ecological work validation, restoration project completion, sustainability assessments
*Distribution:* Impact-based payments for verified ecological contributions

## Step 1: Treasury Foundation and Financial Infrastructure

- Innovation and experimentation with new approaches to regenerative economics
- Learning exchange with other communities implementing similar economic systems

## Step 5: Community Enterprises and External Economic Relationships

While Hearts and Leaves currencies handle internal community needs, fiat currency income from community enterprises and external relationships provides the resources for AUBI Layer 1 and external obligations.

### **Community Enterprise Development**

**Values-Aligned Business Development:**
- Develop businesses and services that align with community values while generating fiat income
- Create cooperative ownership structures that distribute business benefits throughout the community
- Implement triple-bottom-line accounting that measures social and environmental impact alongside financial returns
- Develop business plans that prioritize community benefit and ecological health alongside financial sustainability

**Skills-Based Enterprise Creation:**
- Inventory community member skills and expertise that could generate external income
- Create consulting and service provision opportunities in ecological restoration, community development, and regenerative systems
- Develop educational and training programs that serve external audiences while building internal capacity
- Create artisan and agricultural production cooperatives that serve both community needs and external markets

**Community Investment and Ownership:**
- Create investment opportunities for community members to support enterprise development with Hearts, Leaves, or fiat
- Implement profit-sharing systems that distribute business success throughout the community
- Develop community ownership models that prevent individual accumulation of wealth from community resources
- Create transparent governance systems for community enterprises with democratic oversight and accountability

### **External Economic Integration**

**Bioregional Economic Relationships:**
- Participate in bioregional economic networks and alternative currency systems
- Develop trade relationships with other BAZs and regenerative communities for mutual benefit
- Create resource sharing agreements that reduce dependence on extractive economic systems
- Coordinate with other communities on joint enterprises and cooperative economic development

**Government and Institutional Relationships:**
- Explore contracts and partnerships with government agencies for environmental restoration and community services
- Develop relationships with educational institutions for research partnerships and student programs
- Create consulting and technical assistance relationships with other communities and organizations
- Participate in grant programs and social investment opportunities aligned with community values

**Market Transformation and Systems Change:**
- Use community enterprises as demonstrations of alternative economic models
- Share innovations and successful approaches with other communities and economic development organizations
- Advocate for policy changes that support regenerative economics and community-controlled development
- Create educational and outreach programs that spread understanding of regenerative economic principles

## Common Economic Development Challenges and Solutions

### **The Transition Period Cash Flow Challenge**
*Challenge:* Maintaining financial stability during the transition from fiat-dependent to regenerative economic systems.

*Solutions:*
- Phase in alternative currency systems gradually while maintaining fiat income sources
- Create diverse revenue streams from multiple community enterprises and external relationships
- Build substantial reserve funds before reducing dependence on external income
- Develop emergency economic protocols for unexpected financial challenges

### **The Currency Valuation and Stability Issue**
*Challenge:* Maintaining stable and meaningful value for Hearts and Leaves currencies while avoiding inflation or deflation.

*Solutions:*
- Base currency valuation on measurable outcomes (community well-being, ecological health) rather than arbitrary standards
- Create community governance systems that can adjust currency policies based on experience and outcomes
- Implement currency buffers and reserve systems that provide stability during fluctuations
- Connect with other communities using similar systems for mutual support and learning

### **The External Interface Complexity**

## The Engine of Life's Economy

The economic transformation of Pillar 6 represents more than changing currencies or payment systems—it's about aligning economic activity with the patterns and principles that create and sustain life. In nature, there are no waste products, no unemployment, no scarcity that isn't temporary, and no accumulation that doesn't eventually return to the cycle of giving and receiving.

Your regenerative economy learns from these patterns. Care work is recognized because healthy communities, like healthy ecosystems, depend on the patient, often invisible work of tending relationships and maintaining social soil. Ecological restoration is rewarded because economic systems that destroy their foundation are ultimately suicidal.

The Hearts and Leaves currencies don't just represent different values—they represent different ways of understanding value itself. Hearts recognize that human well-being emerges from love, connection, meaning, and care rather than just material accumulation. Leaves recognize that human prosperity is inseparable from ecological health and that true wealth is measured in the flourishing of all life.

The AUBI system provides the security that enables people to follow their gifts and serve their communities rather than just surviving in jobs that may contribute nothing meaningful to the world. When basic needs are guaranteed, people are free to discover and contribute their unique talents to the collective work of building the world we all want to live in.

Most importantly, this economic system is designed to get better over time rather than worse. Unlike extractive economies that eventually exhaust their resources and relationships, regenerative economies create more value than they consume, healing damage while meeting needs, building social and ecological capital while providing for immediate requirements.

The engine you ignite in Pillar 6 powers everything else your community does. It funds your governance systems, enables your ecological restoration work, supports your cultural development, and provides the resources for your participation in the broader GGF network. But more than that, it demonstrates that another economy is possible—one that serves life rather than exploiting it.

*"Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day I can hear her breathing."* - Arundhati Roy

*"The most remarkable feature of this historical moment on Earth is not that we are on the way to destroying the world—we've actually been on the way for quite a while. It is that we are beginning to wake up, as from a millennia-long sleep, to a whole new relationship to our world, to ourselves and each other."* - Joanna Macy

The economy you create today is part of that new world breathing herself into existence. Every Hearts transaction is an act of recognizing and honoring care. Every Leaves payment is an investment in ecological healing. Every AUBI distribution is a declaration that every human being deserves dignity and the freedom to contribute their gifts to the world.

**Your regenerative economy is not just supporting your community—it's proving that an economy based on love, care, and ecological wisdom is not only possible but more efficient, more satisfying, and more sustainable than the extraction-based systems it's designed to replace.**

What engine will you build? What values will power your economy? How will you prove that another world is possible?

The fuel is abundant. The design is proven. The need is urgent.

**It's time to ignite the engine of the regenerative economy your world is waiting for.**
