# Becoming a BAZ: Graduation and Network Integration

*From Experiment to Institution: Formalizing Your Journey*

---

After months or years of foundational work through the six pillars, your community reaches a critical threshold. You've developed shared vision, mapped your bioregion, established governance structures, and begun economic experiments. But when do you stop being a "community in formation" and become an actual Bioregional Autonomous Zone?

The transition from experimental community to recognized BAZ is both ceremonial milestone and practical metamorphosis. It marks your readiness to take on the responsibilities and benefits of full integration with the Global Governance Framework network.

## The BAZ Readiness Assessment

## The Chartering Process

### **Internal Community Ratification**

- Communities that serve as bridges between the GGF network and external institutions or cultures

### **Graceful Transition Planning**

**Dignified Dissolution:**
- Clear processes for communities that decide to discontinue BAZ formation efforts
- Protection for vulnerable members during community transitions
- Resource transfer protocols that honor member contributions and investments
- Knowledge preservation ensuring that lessons learned benefit other communities

**Transformation Options:**
- Evolution into different community forms that better serve members' needs and capacity
- Merger with other communities or integration into existing BAZ structures
- Spin-off of successful elements while discontinuing others
- Gradual transition back to more conventional community forms while retaining innovative elements

## The Larger Purpose

The recognition of new BAZs represents more than administrative process—it embodies the growing reality of regenerative civilization. Each community that achieves BAZ status demonstrates that alternatives to extractive, hierarchical systems are not just possible but practical.

Your graduation to BAZ status contributes to a larger transformation:
- Proof that democratic, ecological, and economically just communities can thrive
- Models that inspire other communities and influence broader policy discussions  
- Networks of mutual aid and solidarity that provide security in an uncertain world
- Cultural innovations that point toward more beautiful ways of being human together

The ceremony that marks your becoming a BAZ is simultaneously celebration of your community's achievement and affirmation of your commitment to the larger work of planetary healing and social transformation.

**You are no longer just tending your own garden—you are stewarding the seeds of the world we all need.**

Welcome to the network. The real work begins now.
