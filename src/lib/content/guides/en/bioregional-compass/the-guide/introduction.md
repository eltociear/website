# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

*A Practical and Soulful Path to Regenerative Community*

---

The polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies—demands a radical reimagining of how we live. The old ways of organizing society have brought us to the edge of ecological and social breakdown. Yet within this crisis lies an invitation: to remember what it means to belong to a place, to care for one another, and to live in right relationship with the living world.

The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide, aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF), is a comprehensive blueprint for building regenerative communities rooted in reciprocity with land and people. This is not a utopian dream—it is a practical response to the challenges of our time, grounded in Indigenous wisdom and tested by communities around the world who are already walking this path.

From homesteads to bioregions, this guide provides both the vision and the tools to create communities that are:
- **Ecologically regenerative**, healing damaged landscapes while meeting human needs
- **Socially just**, ensuring dignity and agency for all beings
- **Economically sovereign**, valuing care work and ecological stewardship alongside material production
- **Culturally vibrant**, honoring ancestral wisdom while fostering innovation
- **Politically empowered**, governing themselves while contributing to the wider web of life

## What Is a Bioregional Autonomous Zone?

A Bioregional Autonomous Zone is a community organized around the natural boundaries of an ecosystem—usually a watershed—rather than the arbitrary lines drawn by nation-states. It is a place where people have chosen to take responsibility for the health of their bioregion and the wellbeing of all who inhabit it.

BAZs are:
- **Bioregional** because they align human governance with ecological boundaries
- **Autonomous** because they exercise meaningful self-determination within their sphere
- **Zones** because they are specific places with defined territories and relationships

But BAZs are not isolated islands. They are nodes in a growing network of regenerative communities, connected through the Global Governance Frameworks to share knowledge, resources, and mutual aid. They represent a new form of organization that transcends the limitations of both the nation-state system and purely local initiatives.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is written for dreamers who are also builders—people who see the need for fundamental change and are willing to do the patient work of creating it. You might be:

- **Rural communities** seeking greater self-reliance and ecological harmony
- **Urban neighborhoods** working to relocalize their economies and governance
- **Indigenous nations** reclaiming traditional governance while engaging with the modern world
- **Intentional communities** wanting to scale their impact beyond their immediate boundaries
- **Climate activists** ready to move from protest to the creation of alternatives
- **Local leaders** seeking new models for municipal governance
- **Anyone** who feels called to be part of the solution

You don't need to be an expert in ecology, economics, or governance to begin. What you need is a commitment to learning, a willingness to work with others, and a deep love for the place you call home.

## A Living Document for a Living Movement

The formation of a BAZ is not a linear process with a clear endpoint. It is an ongoing dance of vision and pragmatism, of dreaming and building, of honoring tradition while embracing innovation. This guide reflects that reality.

The six pillars we present here are meant to be revisited cyclically as your community grows and evolves. The legal work of Pillar 3 may reshape the vision of Pillar 1. The economic realities of Pillar 6 may require you to revisit the governance models of Pillar 4. This is not a bug—it's a feature of living systems.

Similarly, this guide recognizes that one size does not fit all. A BAZ of 50 people will have different needs than one of 5,000. A community in the Global North will face different challenges than one in the Global South. An Indigenous-led initiative will have different priorities than a settler community. Throughout this guide, we offer adaptations for different scales, contexts, and circumstances.

## The Path Ahead

The journey from where you are now to a thriving Bioregional Autonomous Zone may seem daunting. That's why we've created the **BAZ Starter Pack**—a simplified one-page roadmap that helps small or new communities begin without overwhelm. You can take the first steps toward your BAZ with as few as 5-10 committed people and a budget of just a few thousand dollars.

Remember: every great oak was once an acorn that held its ground. Your BAZ begins with a single conversation, a shared dream, and the courage to take the first step. The world is waiting for what you and your community will create.

*The future is not something that happens to us—it is something we make together, one bioregion at a time.*
