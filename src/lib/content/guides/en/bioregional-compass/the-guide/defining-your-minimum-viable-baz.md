# Defining Your Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB)

*Your First Milestone: From Planning to Living Reality*

---

One of the biggest challenges in community formation is knowing when you've moved from "working toward a BAZ" to "being a BAZ." Without clear milestones, communities can spend years in perpetual preparation, always planning for tomorrow but never celebrating today's achievements. The Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB) concept provides a concrete target—your first major milestone that marks the transition from aspiration to operational reality.

## What Is a Minimum Viable BAZ?

Your MVB is the simplest version of your community that can still legitimately call itself a functioning Bioregional Autonomous Zone. It's not the final form of your vision—it's the first stable platform from which you can grow and evolve.

Think of it as the seed that contains the DNA of your mature community. A seed doesn't look like a tree, but it contains everything necessary to become one under the right conditions. Your MVB contains the essential elements of governance, economy, territory, and relationships that can develop into a full bioregional community over time.

**Key Characteristics of an MVB:**
- **Operational, not theoretical:** Real people doing real work with measurable outcomes
- **Self-sustaining:** Can maintain basic functions without constant crisis management  
- **Demonstrable:** Visible proof of your values in action that others can witness and learn from
- **Scalable:** A foundation that can grow and deepen rather than needing to be rebuilt
- **Resilient:** Can weather normal challenges and setbacks without collapse

## The Six Domains of MVB Development

Your MVB should demonstrate basic functionality across six key domains, corresponding to the six pillars of BAZ formation:

### **Domain 1: Shared Consciousness (Pillar 0 & 1)**
*The inner and collective foundation that animates everything else*

**MVB Markers:**
- Regular community gatherings with 70%+ attendance from core members
- Shared vision statement that 80%+ of participants can articulate and support
- Functional conflict resolution processes that have successfully navigated at least 2-3 significant disagreements
- Evidence of collective decision-making (not just one or two people making all choices)

**Sample Metrics:**
- Monthly community meetings averaging 15+ participants for 6+ consecutive months
- Vision statement survey showing 80%+ agreement and understanding
- Documented conflict resolution cases with satisfactory outcomes for all parties

### **Domain 2: Bioregional Relationship (Pillar 2)**
*Clear connection to place and ecosystem health*

**MVB Markers:**
- Defined territorial boundaries that make ecological sense (watershed, foodshed, or ecosystem)
- Respectful relationship with Indigenous peoples established through FPIC 2.0 protocols
- At least one measurable improvement in local ecosystem health
- Community knowledge of seasonal cycles, local species, and ecological patterns

**Sample Metrics:**
- Mapped boundaries encompassing a coherent ecological unit (minimum 100 acres or urban equivalent)
- Formal acknowledgment or partnership agreement with relevant Indigenous nations
- Documented improvement in one ecological indicator (water quality, native plant populations, soil health)
- 50%+ of community members can identify 10+ local native species

### **Domain 3: Legal Foundation (Pillar 3)**
*Sufficient legal structure to operate with legitimacy and protection*

**MVB Markers:**
- Legal entity established (cooperative, non-profit, community land trust, or similar)
- Basic compliance with local laws and regulations
- Founding charter or equivalent document ratified by community
- Relationship established with at least one level of government (municipal, county, or state)

**Sample Metrics:**
- Legal incorporation completed with appropriate organizational structure
- No outstanding legal violations or unresolved compliance issues
- Community-ratified governing document (charter, bylaws, or constitution)
- At least one formal partnership or recognition from government entity

### **Domain 4: Democratic Governance (Pillar 4)**
*Functional decision-making systems that serve the whole community*

**MVB Markers:**
- Regular democratic assemblies or council meetings with broad participation
- Clear processes for major decisions that involve the full community
- Rotating leadership roles with successful transitions between leaders
- Accountability mechanisms that prevent power concentration

**Sample Metrics:**
- Monthly governance meetings with 60%+ participation from eligible members
- At least 3 major community decisions made through inclusive democratic process
- Leadership roles rotated among at least 3-5 different people over 12 months
- Community feedback system showing 70%+ satisfaction with governance processes

### **Domain 5: Network Integration (Pillar 5)**
*Connection to the broader movement and mutual support systems*

**MVB Markers:**
- Active relationship with at least 2-3 other BAZs or allied communities
- Participation in GGF frameworks and Meta-Governance coordination
- Contribution to knowledge commons through documentation and sharing
- Access to external resources and expertise when needed

**Sample Metrics:**
- Regular communication/collaboration with peer communities (monthly contact minimum)
- Participation in at least 2 GGF working groups or initiatives
- Publication of lessons learned, case studies, or resource guides for other communities
- Successfully accessed external support for at least one significant challenge

### **Domain 6: Economic Resilience (Pillar 6)**
*Working economic systems that serve community needs and values*

**MVB Markers:**
- AUBI Layer 1 payments reaching at least 50% of participating households
- Active use of Hearts and/or Leaves currencies for real economic activity
- At least 25% of basic needs met through local production or exchange
- Community treasury functioning with transparent accounting

**Sample Metrics:**
- Monthly AUBI payments reaching 10+ households for 6+ consecutive months
- Hearts/Leaves transactions totaling equivalent of $1,000+ monthly in community trade
- Local food, housing, or services meeting 25% of community needs
- Treasury records showing income, expenses, and reserves with community access

## Creating Your Community-Specific MVB

While these domains provide a framework, each community must define their own specific MVB based on their context, resources, and aspirations. Use this collaborative process:

### **Step 1: Visioning Your MVB (2-3 community meetings)**

**Guiding Questions:**
- If we achieved our MVB in 18 months, what would be visibly different about our daily lives?
- What would a visitor notice about our community that proves we're "actually doing this"?
- What capabilities would we need to weather a typical crisis (economic downturn, key person leaving, conflict)?
- What would make us proud to say "we're a functioning BAZ" rather than "we're working toward becoming a BAZ"?

**Process:**
- Individual reflection and visioning
- Small group sharing and synthesis  
- Large group dialogue to identify common themes
- Working group refinement into specific markers

### **Step 2: Reality-Testing Your MVB (1-2 meetings)**

**Challenging Questions:**
- Given our current resources and capacity, is this MVB achievable in 12-24 months?
- Are we being too ambitious (leading to burnout) or too modest (lacking inspiration)?
- Do our proposed markers actually demonstrate the values we claim to hold?
- Would achieving this MVB create a stable foundation for our next phase of growth?

**Process:**
- Skills and resources inventory
- Timeline and capacity assessment
- Stress-testing against likely challenges
- Adjustment and refinement of markers

### **Step 3: Committing to Your MVB (1 decisive meeting)**

**Key Decisions:**
- Final agreement on specific MVB markers and metrics
- Assignment of working groups responsible for each domain
- Timeline with quarterly milestones and check-ins
- Accountability processes and course-correction protocols

**Process:**
- Formal community vote on proposed MVB
- Working group formation and responsibility assignment
- Creation of tracking and reporting systems
- Celebration of commitment and launch

## Sample MVB: The Riverbend Community

*A hypothetical example of how one community might define their MVB*

**Context:** Rural community of 45 adults and 12 children working with 300 acres in a mountain watershed

**Domain 1 - Shared Consciousness:**
- Monthly community circles with 35+ adults participating regularly
- Conflict mediation process that has successfully resolved 3+ significant disputes
- Quarterly vision renewal process showing consistent 85%+ alignment

**Domain 2 - Bioregional Relationship:**  
- Restoration of 2-mile creek corridor with measurable water quality improvement
- Partnership agreement with local Tribal Nation including annual ceremony
- Community members maintain phenology calendar and seed bank

**Domain 3 - Legal Foundation:**
- Community land trust legally established and holding property title
- County relationship formalized through rural services agreement
- Community charter ratified with 90%+ approval

**Domain 4 - Democratic Governance:**
- Bioregional Council meeting monthly with rotating facilitation

**Target Timeline:** 24 months from charter ratification  
**Key Milestones:** Quarterly assessments with annual community celebration

## Tracking Your MVB Progress: The BAZ Dashboard

Once you've defined your MVB, you need systems to track progress and maintain accountability. The BAZ Dashboard provides a simple, visual way to monitor your development across all six domains.

### **Dashboard Components:**

**Monthly Metrics Collection:**
- Simple surveys for community members
- Working group reports on specific indicators  
- External verification for key claims (ecological improvements, financial systems)

**Quarterly Progress Reviews:**
- Community meetings to assess dashboard results
- Celebration of achievements and acknowledgment of challenges
- Course corrections and resource reallocation as needed

**Annual MVB Assessment:**
- Comprehensive evaluation of progress toward MVB markers
- Decision on whether MVB has been achieved or timeline needs adjustment
- Community celebration and transition to post-MVB planning

### **Dashboard Visualization:**

The dashboard uses simple traffic light colors for each domain:
- **Green:** On track to meet MVB markers within timeline
- **Yellow:** Making progress but may need additional attention or resources
- **Red:** Significant challenges requiring community focus and problem-solving

## Beyond Your MVB: The Growth Trajectory

Achieving your MVB is not the end goal—it's the beginning of your real work as a mature BAZ. Think of your MVB as graduation from "BAZ formation" to "BAZ operation and evolution."

### **Post-MVB Development Phases:**

**Phase 1: Stabilization (Year 1 post-MVB)**
- Maintaining MVB achievements while addressing any remaining weak points
- Building deeper resilience in all six domains
- Developing systems for ongoing assessment and improvement

**Phase 2: Expansion (Years 2-3 post-MVB)**  
- Increasing scale and impact within existing territory
- Taking on more complex challenges and initiatives
- Supporting formation of additional BAZs in bioregion

**Phase 3: Leadership (Years 4+ post-MVB)**
- Bioregional coordination and policy influence
- Significant contribution to GGF meta-governance
- Innovation and experimentation that benefits the broader movement

## Common MVB Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### **The Perfectionism Trap**
*Setting MVB markers so high that they become demotivating rather than inspiring*

**Solution:** Remember that your MVB should be the minimum viable version, not the ideal version. You can always exceed your markers, but you need to be able to achieve them.

### **The Moving Goalpost Problem**
*Continuously raising standards when you get close to achieving your MVB*

**Solution:** Commit to your MVB markers formally and publicly. Once achieved, celebrate fully before setting new goals for your next development phase.

### **The Imbalanced Development Issue**  
*Focusing heavily on some domains while neglecting others*

**Solution:** Regularly review progress across all six domains and redirect resources to shore up weak areas before they become critical problems.

### **The Timeline Trap**
*Setting unrealistic timelines that create pressure and burnout*

**Solution:** Build buffer time into your timeline and plan for the reality that community development is slower and more complex than most other projects.

## Your MVB Declaration

When your community is ready to commit to your MVB, consider creating a formal declaration that captures both your specific markers and your broader commitment. This declaration can be signed by community members, shared with your network, and referred to during challenging times.

**Sample MVB Declaration Framework:**

*"We, the members of [Community Name], declare our commitment to achieving our Minimum Viable BAZ by [Date]. We will know we have succeeded when we can demonstrate [Domain 1 marker], [Domain 2 marker], [etc.]. We make this commitment not as an end in itself, but as our foundation for the longer journey toward a fully regenerative bioregional community. We hold ourselves accountable to these markers and to each other, and we invite our broader community to witness and support this commitment."*

## The Deeper Purpose of Your MVB

Beyond its practical function as a milestone and accountability tool, your MVB serves a deeper purpose in your community's development. It transforms the abstract vision of a BAZ into concrete, achievable goals that people can work toward together. It creates a shared definition of success that prevents endless debates about whether you're "there yet."

Most importantly, your MVB creates a moment of celebration and recognition. Community formation is long, difficult work that often happens in invisibility. Your MVB achievement is a chance to step back, acknowledge how far you've come, and celebrate the foundation you've built together.

From that foundation, anything is possible.

*"The best way to make dreams come true is to wake up and start working on them."* - Paulo Coelho

Your MVB is how you wake up. Your mature BAZ is the dream you're working toward.
