# Legal Structure Decision Tree

*Choosing the Right Legal Entities for Your Community*

---

Selecting legal structures for your BAZ is one of the most consequential decisions you'll make during formation. The wrong choice can create tax burdens, governance conflicts, liability exposure, or regulatory obstacles that persist for years. The right combination of entities provides protection, flexibility, and alignment with your community's goals.

This guide walks through the decision process systematically, helping you choose structures that serve your community rather than constraining it.

## Before You Begin: Understanding Your Needs

Legal structure selection should be driven by your community's specific circumstances, not abstract preferences or ideological positions about different business forms.

### Community Assessment Framework

Answer these questions before evaluating legal structures:

**Size and Growth Plans:**
- How many adult members do you expect in year 1? Year 5?
- Will you have children living in community?
- Do you plan to accept new members ongoing or remain closed?

**Economic Activities:**
- Will members share income or maintain individual financial independence?
- What businesses or enterprises will the community operate?
- How will property and assets be owned and managed?
- Do you plan to accept donations or grants?

**Property and Assets:**
- Will the community own land and buildings?
- How much property value will be involved?
- Who will hold title and liability for property?
- What happens to assets if members leave?

**Governance Preferences:**
- How will major decisions be made?
- What role will members have in management?
- How will conflicts be resolved?
- What legal compliance are you willing to manage?

**Risk Tolerance:**
- What activities pose potential liability risks?
- How much regulatory complexity can you handle?
- What level of personal financial exposure is acceptable?
- How important is privacy vs. transparency?

## Multi-Entity Structure Design

- Provides permanent community ownership of land
- Allows members to build equity through cooperative ownership
- Protects against gentrification and speculation

## Decision Tree Walkthrough

Use this step-by-step process to identify the best legal structure combination for your community:

### Step 1: Primary Purpose Classification

**Question:** What is your community's primary purpose?

**If Education/Environmental/Community Service → Consider 501(c)(3) Nonprofit**
- Evaluate: Will commercial activities be minimal?
- Evaluate: Is tax-exempt status important for your mission?
- Evaluate: Do you want grant eligibility and donation capability?

**If Shared Housing/Living → Consider Housing Cooperative**
- Evaluate: Do members want to build equity in housing?
- Evaluate: Is democratic housing control important?
- Evaluate: Can you handle cooperative tax complexity?

**If Business/Economic Focus → Consider LLC or Business Cooperative**
- Evaluate: What level of liability protection do you need?
- Evaluate: How complex will profit sharing arrangements be?
- Evaluate: Do you need flexibility in ownership structure?

### Step 2: Asset Protection Assessment

**Question:** How much liability exposure do you have?

**High Exposure (substantial assets, risky activities) → Corporation or LLC Required**
- Consider: Professional liability insurance needs
- Consider: Asset separation strategies
- Consider: Risk segregation between activities

**Medium Exposure → Cooperative or LLC with Insurance**
- Evaluate: Insurance costs vs. structural protection
- Evaluate: Member personal asset exposure comfort level

**Low Exposure → Any Structure with Basic Insurance**
- Focus: Operational flexibility over maximum protection

### Step 3: Member Economics Evaluation

**Question:** How will members share in community economics?

**Equal Sharing of All Income/Expenses → Housing or Worker Cooperative**
- Consider: Tax complexity of shared income arrangements
- Consider: Member agreement enforcement mechanisms

**Proportional Sharing Based on Contribution → LLC or Multi-Class Cooperative**
- Design: Profit allocation formulas and change mechanisms
- Design: Different classes of membership with different rights

**Individual Financial Independence → Nonprofit or Service Cooperative**
- Focus: Community services rather than shared economics
- Consider: How to fund shared resources and activities

### Step 4: Growth and Change Planning

**Question:** How will your community evolve over time?

**Rapid Growth Expected → LLC or Corporation**
- Consider: Capital raising needs for expansion
- Consider: Governance scalability to larger membership
- Consider: Regulatory complexity management

**Slow, Organic Growth → Cooperative or Multi-Entity**
- Design: Member integration processes
- Design: Governance evolution mechanisms

**Stable Size Expected → Any Structure Based on Other Factors**
- Focus: Operational efficiency over growth flexibility

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Ideology Over Practicality:**
Choosing structures based on political preferences rather than practical needs often creates expensive problems later.

**Single Entity Overload:**
Trying to accomplish all community functions through one legal entity usually creates unnecessary complexity and risk.

**Inadequate Liability Protection:**
Underestimating risk exposure can leave community and individual members vulnerable to financial loss.

**Poor Professional Guidance:**
Working with professionals who don't understand intentional communities often results in inappropriate structure recommendations.

**Insufficient Planning for Change:**
Choosing structures that work for initial conditions but can't adapt to community growth and evolution.

The right legal structure serves your community's mission while providing protection and flexibility for the future. Take time to understand your options, consult with experienced professionals, and choose structures that align with your community's actual needs rather than theoretical preferences.

Remember: Legal structures can be changed as your community evolves, but changes are expensive and disruptive. Invest the time and resources needed to make good initial choices that will serve your community well for years to come.
