# Exit Strategy & Dissolution Protocols

*Planning for Transitions, Crises, and Graceful Endings*

---

No community wants to plan for failure or dissolution, but communities that survive challenging periods are those that prepare for difficult transitions before they're needed. Exit strategies and dissolution protocols aren't about expecting failure - they're about creating systems that handle change, crisis, and member transitions with dignity and fairness.

This guide covers member departure procedures, community dissolution planning, crisis response protocols, and the financial and legal mechanisms needed to handle endings gracefully.
