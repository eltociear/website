# Village to Bioregional Transition Guide

*Scaling Democratic Participation for Larger Membership*

---

Communities that successfully navigate the homestead-to-village transition often face a second major challenge as they continue growing: maintaining democratic participation and community coherence when membership exceeds the capacity of village-scale governance systems. This transition typically occurs when communities reach 50-75 active adult members, though the exact trigger depends more on complexity and geographic spread than pure numbers.

The village-to-bioregional transition requires sophisticated governance systems that maintain democratic values while enabling effective coordination across larger, more complex organizations.

## Understanding Bioregional-Scale Governance Needs

### Complexity Factors Driving Transition

**Membership Size and Diversity:**
- More than 50-75 active adult members
- Multiple generations with different communication styles and priorities
- Diverse educational, cultural, and economic backgrounds requiring different participation approaches
- Geographic spread across multiple locations or properties

**Organizational Complexity:**
- Multiple working circles or organizations operating semi-independently
- Complex budget and resource management requiring specialized expertise
- Professional staff positions complementing volunteer community labor
- Regulatory compliance requiring specialized knowledge and consistent management

**External Integration:**
- Formal relationships with government agencies requiring consistent representation
- Regional network responsibilities and inter-community coordination
- Business enterprises and economic activities requiring professional management
- Educational programs and external partnerships requiring institutional capacity

### Participation Challenges at Scale

**The 150-Person Limit:**
Anthropologist Robin Dunbar's research suggests humans can maintain stable social relationships with approximately 150 people. Beyond this size, communities require formal systems to coordinate relationships and decision-making.

**Democratic Participation Scaling Problems:**
- Community meetings become unwieldy with full membership participation
- Informal communication networks break down across larger populations
- Decision-making processes become slow and inefficient
- Members feel disconnected from decisions affecting their lives

**Cultural Transmission Challenges:**
- Community values and practices can't be transmitted through personal relationships alone
- New member integration becomes complex and inconsistent
- Institutional memory depends on formal systems rather than personal knowledge
- Innovation and adaptation require intentional systems for community learning

## Nested Council Governance Architecture

### Three-Tier Council Structure

**Tier 1: Working Circles (5-12 members each)**
Functional teams with delegated authority over specific areas of community operations.

*Authority Scope:*
- Day-to-day operational decisions within their domain
- Budget management within allocated resources
- Personnel coordination and work assignment
- Policy implementation and procedure development

*Operating Procedures:*
- Weekly or bi-weekly meetings with rotating facilitation
- Consensus or consent-based decision-making for most issues
- Clear escalation procedures when decisions exceed circle authority
- Regular reporting to Coordination Council about activities and decisions

*Example Circles:*
- Land Stewardship Circle: Property management, environmental restoration, agriculture
- Community Life Circle: Cultural programming, conflict resolution, new member integration  
- Economic Development Circle: Business enterprises, income generation, financial management
- External Relations Circle: Government relations, regional partnerships, public communications

**Tier 2: Coordination Council (7-15 members)**
Representative body coordinating between working circles and making community-wide policy decisions.

*Composition:*
- Delegates from each working circle (elected by their circles)
- At-large members elected by full community assembly
- Community coordinator or administrative staff (non-voting)
- Youth representative with full voting rights

*Authority Scope:*
- Community-wide policy development and major decision-making
- Inter-circle coordination and conflict resolution
- Budget approval and major spending authorization
- Strategic planning and long-term community direction setting

*Operating Procedures:*
- Monthly meetings with quarterly community reporting
- Consent-based decision-making with majority vote backup
- Community consultation requirements for major decisions
- Term limits and rotation to prevent power concentration

**Tier 3: Community Assembly (All members)**
Full membership body retaining ultimate authority over fundamental community decisions.

*Reserved Powers:*
- Constitutional decisions about community mission, values, and structure
- Major financial decisions (annual budget, large capital expenditures)
- Land use and development decisions affecting entire community
- Membership criteria and community expansion decisions

*Operating Procedures:*
- Quarterly assemblies with special meetings as needed
- Multiple participation formats (in-person, remote, written input)
- Supermajority requirements for constitutional decisions
- Professional facilitation for complex or controversial decisions

### Representative Selection Systems

**Circle Delegate Selection:**
- Delegates chosen by their working circles through internal processes
- One-year terms with possibility of re-election

- Recall procedures when delegates don't represent circle interests effectively

**At-Large Member Selection:**
- Community-wide elections using ranked choice voting or similar systems
- Representation requirements ensuring diverse community voices
- Staggered terms to maintain institutional continuity
- Skills-based selection for members with specialized expertise needed by coordination council

**Youth and Special Population Representation:**
- Dedicated seats for youth (under 30) and elder (over 65) perspectives
- Representation for community members with disabilities
- Cultural minority representation when relevant to community composition
- New member representation to ensure integration perspectives are included

## Professional Administration Integration

### Paid Staff Roles

*Process:* Community assembly supermajority after extensive consultation

### Decision Escalation Procedures

**Normal Escalation Flow:**
1. Individual or circle identifies issue requiring decision
2. Circle attempts resolution within their authority scope
3. Issue escalated to Coordination Council if beyond circle authority
4. Issue escalated to Community Assembly if constitutional or requiring supermajority

**Emergency Decision Procedures:**
