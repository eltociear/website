# Emergency Services & Crisis Response

*Coordinating with Law Enforcement and Emergency Responders*

---

BAZ communities inevitably interact with law enforcement, emergency medical services, fire departments, and child protective services. These interactions can range from routine emergency responses to investigations that threaten community operations or individual member safety. Communities that prepare for these interactions and establish clear protocols protect both individual rights and community interests while maintaining cooperative relationships with essential emergency services.

This guide provides frameworks for managing emergency service interactions, legal investigations, and crisis situations involving government agencies.

## Law Enforcement Interactions and Rights Protection

**Investigative Detention (Terry Stops):**
