# Technology Integration & Resilience Playbook - Overview

*Building Technological Capacity That Serves Community Goals*

---

BAZ communities face complex decisions about which technologies to adopt, how to implement them without undermining community relationships, and how to build resilience against technological failures or external disruptions. Technology can enable more sophisticated coordination, resource efficiency, and knowledge sharing while also creating dependencies, surveillance vulnerabilities, and social fragmentation if poorly implemented.

This playbook addresses technology strategy through three specialized guides covering different aspects of building beneficial technological capacity:

## The Three Technology Guides

### **[Technology Resilience & Backup Systems](link-to-technology-resilience-guide)**
*Preparing for technological failures and maintaining essential functions*

**Use this guide when:**
- Planning backup systems for critical community functions
- Building resilience against technology failures or external disruptions
- Maintaining essential capabilities during power outages or internet disruptions
- Developing community technical skills and repair capacity

**Key contents:**
- Critical function backup planning and implementation
- Community technical skill development programs
- Equipment repair and maintenance systems
- Crisis preparedness for technology-dependent operations

## When to Use Which Guide

**Planning Phase:** Focus on Appropriate Technology Assessment to establish evaluation criteria and decision-making processes before adopting specific technologies.

**Implementation Phase:** Emphasize Digital Sovereignty guide when building digital infrastructure and systems for community operations.

**Operations Phase:** Use Technology Resilience guide to maintain and prepare backup systems for ongoing community technology needs.

**Crisis Response:** All three guides contain relevant information, but start with Technology Resilience for immediate continuity planning and backup activation.

## Core Technology Principles

### Human-Centered Technology Integration

Technology should enhance rather than replace human relationships and community decision-making processes.

**Relationship Preservation:**
- Technology adoption that strengthens rather than weakens community social fabric
- Design choices that create opportunities for face-to-face interaction and collaboration
- Resistance to technological solutions that make community life more impersonal or bureaucratic
- Regular evaluation of whether technology use supports or undermines community relationships

**Community Agency and Control:**
- Technology choices that increase rather than decrease community autonomy and self-determination
- Preference for technologies that communities can understand, repair, and modify independently
- Avoidance of technology systems that create dependency on external corporations or authorities
- Community capacity building for technology maintenance and development

### Regenerative Technology Practices

Technology adoption should support rather than undermine environmental sustainability and community resilience.

**Environmental Responsibility:**
- Lifecycle assessment of technology environmental impacts including manufacturing, use, and disposal
- Preference for durable, repairable technology over disposable or planned-obsolescence designs
- Energy efficiency and renewable energy integration for community technology systems
- Local and regional sourcing when possible to reduce transportation and support community economy

**Resource Efficiency and Sharing:**
- Technology sharing systems that maximize utility while minimizing individual ownership requirements
- Community workshops and repair facilities extending technology lifecycle and building local capacity
- Coordination systems that enable efficient resource use and reduce waste
- Integration of technology adoption with broader community sustainability goals

### Democratic Technology Governance

Technology decisions should be made through inclusive community processes that consider impacts on all community members.

**Inclusive Decision-Making:**
- Technology evaluation processes that include community members with different technical knowledge and comfort levels
- Assessment of technology impacts on different demographic groups within the community
- Training and support systems ensuring all community members can benefit from community technology choices
- Regular evaluation of whether technology adoption is creating new forms of inequality or exclusion

**Transparency and Accountability:**
- Clear documentation of technology decisions and their rationale for community review
- Regular evaluation of technology effectiveness and community satisfaction
- Modification and adaptation of technology systems based on community feedback and experience
- Community oversight of technology spending and resource allocation

## Technology Integration Challenges

### The Efficiency vs. Relationship Trade-off

**Challenge:** Many technologies offer efficiency gains that come at the cost of human interaction and community relationships.

**Management Strategies:**
- Explicit evaluation of relationship impacts during technology assessment
- Design of technology implementation that preserves opportunities for human connection
- Regular community feedback about technology impacts on social fabric and community culture
- Willingness to choose less efficient but more relationship-supporting technology options

### The Dependency Dilemma

**Challenge:** Beneficial technologies can create dependencies that make communities vulnerable to external control or system failures.

**Prevention Approaches:**
- Diversified technology portfolios preventing single-point-of-failure vulnerabilities
- Community skill development for technology maintenance and repair
- Backup systems and alternative approaches for essential community functions
- Regular testing of community capacity to function during technology disruptions

### The Digital Divide Risk

**Challenge:** Technology adoption can create new forms of inequality between community members with different technical skills or access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Technology training and support programs ensuring broad community access to benefits
- Multiple pathways for community participation that don't require advanced technical skills
- Assessment of technology impacts on community members with different capabilities and resources
- Community support systems for members who struggle with technology adoption

## Professional Support and Community Networks

### Technical Expertise Development

**Community Capacity Building:**
- Training programs developing community technical skills and knowledge
- Apprenticeship and mentorship relationships with experienced technical community members
- Participation in technology communities and networks that share community values
- Investment in community technical education and skill development

**External Technical Support:**
- Relationships with technology professionals who understand and support community values
- Access to repair and maintenance services for community technology systems
- Consultation and advice resources for complex technology decisions and implementation
- Emergency technical support for system failures and security breaches

### Technology Community Networks

**Cooperative Technology Development:**
- Participation in networks developing and sharing appropriate technology solutions for communities
- Resource sharing and joint purchasing programs reducing individual community technology costs
- Collaboration with other communities on technology development and implementation projects
- Contribution to open source technology development serving broader community movement needs

**Movement Technology Support:**
- Connection with organizations promoting digital rights and community technology sovereignty
- Participation in advocacy efforts for technology policies supporting community development and autonomy
- Support for technology development that serves community needs rather than corporate profits
- Collaboration with social movements using technology for organizing and communication

Technology integration represents both tremendous opportunity and significant risk for BAZ communities. Success requires thoughtful evaluation of technology choices against community values, careful implementation that preserves human relationships and community agency, and ongoing attention to technology impacts on community life and member wellbeing.

The goal is not to reject technology but to use it intentionally in ways that serve community goals while maintaining the human connections and local autonomy that make communities resilient and meaningful places to live.
