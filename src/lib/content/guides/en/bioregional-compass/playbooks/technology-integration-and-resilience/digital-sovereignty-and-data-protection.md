# Digital Sovereignty & Data Protection

*Maintaining Community Control Over Digital Systems and Information*

---

Digital sovereignty means communities have meaningful control over their digital infrastructure, data, and online presence rather than being dependent on corporate platforms and government surveillance systems. For BAZ communities, this includes protecting member privacy, maintaining control over community information, and building digital systems that serve community goals rather than external profit motives.

This guide provides practical frameworks for building community-controlled digital infrastructure and protecting community autonomy in digital spaces.

## Understanding Digital Sovereignty

### Community Data and Information Control

**Community Data Categories:**
- Member personal information and privacy data
- Community financial and operational information
- Governance records and decision-making documentation
- Community knowledge and intellectual property
- External relationship and communication records

**Control vs. Ownership Issues:**
- Legal ownership of data versus practical control over access and use
- Community versus individual data rights and decision-making authority
- External platform terms of service that override community preferences
- Government surveillance and data access rights that communities cannot control

**Data Sovereignty Benefits:**
- Protection of community and member privacy from external surveillance
- Control over how community information is used and shared
- Independence from corporate platform changes and policy modifications
- Ability to customize digital systems to serve specific community needs

### Infrastructure Independence and Community Control

**Digital Infrastructure Components:**
