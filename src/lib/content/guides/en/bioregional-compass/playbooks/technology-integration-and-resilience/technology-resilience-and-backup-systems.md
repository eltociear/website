# Technology Resilience & Backup Systems

*Preparing for Technological Failures and Maintaining Essential Functions*

---

Technology failures are inevitable. Power outages, equipment breakdowns, internet disruptions, and cyberattacks can disable digital systems that communities have come to depend upon. Communities that build resilience into their technology systems can maintain essential functions during disruptions while those that depend entirely on complex technologies may face serious operational challenges when systems fail.

This guide provides frameworks for building technological resilience through backup systems, community skill development, and crisis preparedness that keeps communities functioning during technology disruptions.

Technology resilience requires ongoing investment in backup systems, community skill development, and crisis preparedness, but it provides essential protection against the inevitable technology failures that all communities will face. Success depends on balancing the benefits of complex technology systems with maintaining the capacity to function effectively when those systems fail.

The goal is not to avoid all technology dependencies, but to ensure that technology failures don't disable essential community functions or create crisis situations that communities cannot handle effectively. Communities that build technology resilience are more capable of both benefiting from technology and maintaining autonomy when technology systems fail or become unavailable.
