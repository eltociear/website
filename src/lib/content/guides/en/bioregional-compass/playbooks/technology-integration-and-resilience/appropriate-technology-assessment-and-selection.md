# Appropriate Technology Assessment & Selection

*Evaluating and Choosing Technologies That Serve Community Values*

---

The concept of "appropriate technology" recognizes that the best technology for a given situation is not necessarily the most advanced or efficient, but the one that best serves the specific needs, values, and context of the people using it. For BAZ communities, this means evaluating technologies not just for their technical capabilities, but for their alignment with community goals, their impact on relationships and autonomy, and their long-term sustainability.

This guide provides frameworks for making technology decisions that serve community wellbeing while avoiding the pitfalls of both technophobia and uncritical technology adoption.

## Community Values-Based Assessment Framework

### Core Evaluation Criteria

**Autonomy and Self-Determination:**
Technology should increase rather than decrease community control over essential functions and decision-making processes.

*Assessment Questions:*
- Does this technology increase or decrease community autonomy and self-determination?
- Can the community understand, repair, modify, and maintain this technology independently?
- Are there viable alternatives if the technology becomes unavailable, inappropriate, or controlled by hostile external actors?
- Does adoption create dependency on external corporations, government agencies, or technical experts?
- Can the technology be adapted to serve community-specific needs and values?

*Red Flags:*
- Proprietary systems that cannot be modified or repaired by community members
- Subscription-based services that create ongoing dependency and financial obligation
- Technologies that require specialized expertise unavailable within the community
- Systems that give external actors control over essential community functions

**Community Relationships and Social Fabric:**
Technology should strengthen rather than weaken the human relationships that form the foundation of community life.

*Assessment Questions:*
- Does this technology create opportunities for meaningful face-to-face interaction and collaboration?
- Will implementation support or undermine community decision-making processes and democratic participation?
- How does the technology affect power dynamics and social equality within the community?
- Does the technology enable more people to participate in community life or create new barriers to participation?
- Will this technology make community life more or less personal and relational?

*Warning Signs:*
- Technologies that replace human interaction with digital interfaces
- Systems that centralize decision-making or reduce democratic participation
- Tools that create new forms of inequality or exclusion based on technical skills or access
- Platforms that encourage individual rather than collective activity

**Environmental Sustainability:**
Technology choices should support rather than undermine community environmental goals and bioregional health.

*Assessment Questions:*
- What are the full lifecycle environmental impacts of manufacturing, shipping, using, and disposing of this technology?
- Can the technology be powered by renewable energy sources under community control?
- Does the technology support community environmental goals like waste reduction, energy efficiency, or ecosystem restoration?
- Are there lower-impact alternatives that provide similar benefits?
- Can the technology be repaired, upgraded, and eventually recycled or composted safely?

*Environmental Concerns:*
- High energy consumption that would require expansion of fossil fuel use
- Manufacturing processes involving toxic materials or exploitative labor conditions
- Planned obsolescence designs that create unnecessary waste
- Technologies that enable or encourage increased resource consumption

**Economic Justice and Community Economics:**
Technology adoption should support community economic goals and member economic wellbeing.

*Assessment Questions:*
- Does this technology reduce or increase total community operating costs over its expected lifetime?
- Are the benefits distributed fairly among community members with different economic resources and technical skills?
- Does adoption support local and regional economy or extract resources to distant corporations?
- Can the technology be shared efficiently among community members rather than requiring individual ownership?
- Will this technology create new economic opportunities for community members or enterprises?

*Economic Red Flags:*
- High upfront costs that strain community budgets or create debt obligations
- Ongoing licensing or subscription costs that create permanent financial burden
- Technologies that eliminate local economic opportunities or employment
- Systems that concentrate economic benefits among technically skilled community members

### Holistic Impact Assessment

**Community Wellbeing Evaluation:**
Consider technology impacts on member physical health, mental health, and overall quality of life.

- Does the technology support healthy lifestyle patterns and physical activity?
- Will implementation create stress, anxiety, or conflict among community members?
- Does the technology enhance or diminish opportunities for creative expression and meaningful work?
- How does the technology affect children's development and educational opportunities?

**Cultural Compatibility Assessment:**
Evaluate whether technology adoption aligns with or conflicts with community culture and identity.

- Does the technology support or undermine community values and cultural practices?
- Will implementation require changes to community culture that members are not willing to make?
- Does the technology enable preservation and transmission of community knowledge and traditions?
- How will the technology affect community rituals, celebrations, and cultural expression?

## Technology Decision-Making Process

### Phase 1: Need Identification and Problem Definition (2-4 weeks)

## Implementation Best Practices

### Gradual Adoption and Parallel Systems

**Phased Implementation:**
- Implement new technologies gradually rather than replacing existing systems all at once
- Maintain familiar systems alongside new technologies during transition periods
- Allow community members to adapt at their own pace rather than forcing immediate adoption
- Regular evaluation and adjustment during implementation phases

**Backup System Maintenance:**
- Preserve non-technological alternatives for essential functions even after successful technology adoption
- Maintain community skills and knowledge for traditional approaches
- Test backup systems regularly to ensure they remain functional when needed
- Document procedures for reverting to alternative approaches if technology fails

### Community Support and Training

**Inclusive Training Programs:**
- Technology training that accommodates different learning styles and technical comfort levels
- Peer support systems pairing technically comfortable members with those needing more assistance
- Multiple training opportunities allowing people to learn at their own pace
- Ongoing support and troubleshooting assistance for all community members

**Skill Development and Empowerment:**
- Training programs that build community capacity for technology maintenance and repair
- Educational opportunities that help community members understand rather than just use technology
- Leadership development for community members to manage and oversee technology systems
- Knowledge sharing systems that distribute rather than concentrate technical expertise

### Ongoing Evaluation and Adaptation

**Regular Technology Assessment:**
- Annual or bi-annual evaluation of technology effectiveness and community satisfaction
- Cost-benefit analysis based on actual experience rather than initial projections
- Assessment of technology impacts on community relationships and culture
- Evaluation of whether technology continues to serve community goals and values

**Adaptive Management:**
- Flexibility to modify, upgrade, or discontinue technologies based on community experience
- Willingness to admit mistakes and change course when technologies don't serve community well
- Integration of lessons learned into future technology decision-making processes
- Sharing of experience and insights with other communities considering similar technologies

The goal of appropriate technology assessment is not to find perfect solutions, but to make thoughtful decisions that serve community wellbeing while avoiding technologies that undermine community values or create unacceptable risks. Success requires ongoing attention to technology impacts and willingness to adapt approaches based on community experience and changing circumstances.
