---

**For communities who want to begin immediately without overwhelm**

This ultra-condensed roadmap helps small or new communities take their first steps toward becoming a BAZ using just three essential actions over 6-12 months. Perfect for groups of 5-20 people who are ready to move from inspiration to action.

## **Step 1: Spark the Vision** 
*Foundation: Pillar 1 - Vision & Consensus Building*

### What You'll Do
- **Form a Convening Circle** of 5-10 diverse community members
- **Host a Community Dialogue** using the four core questions:
  - What makes this place unique and precious to us?
  - What does a thriving future look like for our grandchildren?
  - What are our deepest community challenges right now?
  - What values and principles should guide our decisions?
- **Draft a Shared Vision Statement** that captures your collective dream

### Your Toolkit
**Community Dialogue Kit**: Facilitator questions, icebreakers, conflict navigation tools, vision statement templates

### Investment Required
- **Budget:** $200-500 (meeting space, materials, refreshments)
- **Time:** 1-2 months, 2-4 community gatherings
- **People:** 5-10 committed core members

### Success Marker
✅ **A clear vision statement that 80% of your group enthusiastically supports**

## **Step 2: Map Your Place**
*Foundation: Pillar 2 - Defining the Bioregion*

### What You'll Do
- **Create a basic watershed map** using free online tools and local knowledge
- **Honor Indigenous territories** through respectful research and outreach (FPIC 2.0)
- **Identify key landmarks** - ecological, cultural, and sacred sites
- **Define your initial zone** - the specific area you'll focus on first

### Your Toolkit
**Bioregional Mapping for Beginners**: Simple GIS tutorials, Indigenous consultation protocols, cultural mapping techniques

### Investment Required
- **Budget:** $500-1,000 (mapping software, consultation fees, workshop materials)
- **Time:** 2-3 months, 4-6 mapping workshops
- **People:** 3-5 members interested in ecology and place-based knowledge

### Success Marker
✅ **A simple but accurate map showing your watershed, key features, and cultural relationships**

---

## **Step 3: Start Small**
*Foundation: Pillar 6 - Economic Sovereignty*

### What You'll Do
- **Launch a pilot project** that embodies your values in action:
  - Community food hub (bulk buying, preservation, seed swaps)
  - Care network (childcare co-op, elder support, skill sharing)  
  - Restoration project (stream cleanup, native plantings, habitat work)
- **Test AUBI Layer 1 payments** with 5-10 volunteer households
- **Create a simple community treasury** to track shared resources and payments

### Your Toolkit
**First 100 Days with AUBI**: Treasury templates, payment guides, legal compliance basics, troubleshooting support

### Investment Required
- **Budget:** $1,000-5,000 (pilot project costs, initial AUBI payments, treasury setup)
- **Time:** 3-6 months, ongoing coordination and monthly gatherings
- **People:** Full founding group plus interested community members (10-20 people)

### Success Marker
✅ **Demonstrable proof that your vision translates into tangible action improving people's lives**

**Total Investment: $1,700-6,500** • **Total Time: 6 months** • **Core Team: 5-10 people**

---

## **Milestone Markers: How You'll Know You're Succeeding**

**🌱 Month 2:** Shared vision statement completed and embraced by founding group

**🗺️ Month 4:** Basic bioregional map created with community input and Indigenous acknowledgment

**💚 Month 6:** First pilot project operational and first AUBI payments distributed

**🌍 Year 1:** 20-30 people regularly engaged, multiple projects active, expanding AUBI participation

---

## **Next Steps: Scaling Your Success**

Once you've completed these three foundational steps, you'll be ready to engage with the full Six Pillar process:

- **Year 1-2:** Pillar 3 (Legal structures) and Pillar 4 (Governance formation)
- **Year 2-3:** Pillar 5 (GGF integration) to connect with the broader movement
- **Year 3-5:** Mature your economic systems and expand impact

---

## **Emergency Support: When You Get Stuck**

**Problem:** Can't find 5-10 committed people  
**Solution:** Start with 3, focus on relationship building before projects

**Problem:** Limited budget  
**Solution:** Begin with free tools, volunteer-led workshops, and crowdfunding

**Problem:** Legal concerns about alternative currencies  
**Solution:** Start with time-banking and skill-sharing before monetary systems

**Problem:** Resistance from local authorities  
**Solution:** Frame early work as community organizing, not governance challenges

---

## **Connect to the Network**

You're not doing this alone. Connect with:
- **Bioregional Federation** for peer learning and mutual support
- **GGF Mentorship Network** for guidance from experienced communities  
- **Resource Commons** for templates, tools, and troubleshooting help

---

## **The Bottom Line**

**Starting a BAZ doesn't require perfection—it requires commitment.**

With 5-10 dedicated people, $2,000-6,000, and 6 months of focused effort, you can create the foundation for a thriving regenerative community. The world needs what you're building. Your bioregion is calling for stewards. The only question is: when do you begin?
