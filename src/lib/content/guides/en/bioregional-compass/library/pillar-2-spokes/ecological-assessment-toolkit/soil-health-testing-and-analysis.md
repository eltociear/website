# Soil Health Testing & Analysis

*Comprehensive Soil Assessment for Agricultural and Ecological Planning*

---

Soil health assessment provides the foundation for all terrestrial ecosystem management, agricultural planning, and infrastructure development decisions. Healthy soil supports plant growth, filters water, stores carbon, and sustains the biological communities essential for ecosystem function. Systematic soil testing enables communities to understand soil conditions, monitor changes over time, and make informed decisions about land use and soil improvement strategies.

## Understanding Soil Health Concepts

### Soil as Living System

**Soil Health vs. Soil Quality:**
Soil health emphasizes the biological activity and ecosystem functions of soil, while soil quality traditionally focused on chemical and physical properties for agricultural production.

**Key Soil Health Principles:**
- Soil supports diverse biological communities including bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates
- Living soils cycle nutrients efficiently and build organic matter over time
- Healthy soils have good structure that allows water infiltration and root penetration
- Soil health integrates physical, chemical, and biological properties into ecosystem function

**Soil Ecosystem Services:**
- Carbon storage and climate regulation through organic matter accumulation
- Water filtration and storage reducing flooding and providing clean groundwater
- Nutrient cycling and availability for plant growth and ecosystem productivity
- Habitat and food web support for soil organisms and above-ground biodiversity

### Soil Formation and Characteristics

**Soil Development Processes:**
Understanding how soils form helps communities work with rather than against natural soil development processes.

*Parent Material and Geology:*
- Bedrock and geological materials that provide mineral components of soil
- Glacial deposits, alluvial sediments, and weathered rock that form soil foundation
- Local geology affects soil pH, nutrient availability, and drainage characteristics
- Understanding of geological influences helps predict soil capabilities and limitations

*Climate and Topographic Influences:*
- Temperature and precipitation patterns affecting soil development and biological activity
- Slope and aspect influences on water movement and soil erosion patterns
- Microclimate variations creating different soil conditions across landscape
- Elevation and drainage effects on soil moisture and development patterns

## Physical Soil Assessment

### Soil Texture and Structure Analysis

**Understanding Soil Physical Properties:**
Soil texture and structure determine water movement, root penetration, and many other soil functions essential for plant growth and ecosystem health.

*Soil Texture Assessment - Jar Test Method:*

**Equipment Needed:**
- Clear glass jars (quart mason jars work well)
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Calculator
- Data recording sheets
- Camera for documentation

**Jar Test Procedure:**
1. Collect representative soil samples from 0-6 inch depth in areas with different management
2. Remove organic matter and large particles, use approximately 1/2 cup of soil per jar
3. Fill jar 1/3 full with soil sample, add water to 2/3 full
4. Add 1 teaspoon liquid detergent to aid particle separation
5. Shake vigorously for 2-3 minutes ensuring all soil particles are suspended
6. Set jar aside and allow to settle for 24 hours undisturbed
7. Measure thickness of each layer: sand (bottom), silt (middle), clay (top)
8. Calculate percentages: (layer thickness/total soil thickness) × 100

*Soil Texture Classification:*
- Sandy soils (70%+ sand): Good drainage, easy to work, low water and nutrient holding capacity
- Clay soils (40%+ clay): Poor drainage, hard when dry, high water and nutrient holding capacity
- Loam soils (balanced sand/silt/clay): Ideal for most plants, good drainage and nutrient retention
- Use soil texture triangle to classify soil type based on sand/silt/clay percentages

### Soil Structure and Compaction Assessment

**Evaluating Soil Physical Condition:**
Soil structure affects root penetration, water movement, and biological activity more than soil texture.

*Visual Assessment of Soil Structure:*
- Dig soil profile pit 12-18 inches deep in representative areas
- Observe soil aggregation and pore space development
- Document root penetration depth and distribution patterns
- Assess earthworm activity and other biological indicators

*Compaction Testing Methods:*

**Penetrometer Testing:**
- Use soil penetrometer or simple probe to measure soil resistance
- Test at multiple locations and depths to identify compaction layers
- Record measurements in pounds per square inch (PSI) or depth of penetration
- Compare compaction levels in trafficked vs. untrafficked areas

**Infiltration Rate Testing:**
1. Hammer metal ring 2-3 inches into soil surface
2. Fill ring with water and record time for complete infiltration
3. Repeat test multiple times and calculate average infiltration rate
4. Compare rates between different management areas and soil types
5. Infiltration rates >1 inch per hour indicate good soil structure

## Chemical Soil Testing and Analysis
