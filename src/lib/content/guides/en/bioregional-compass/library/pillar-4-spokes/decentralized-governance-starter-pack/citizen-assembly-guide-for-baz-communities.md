# Citizen Assembly Guide for BAZ Communities

*Democratic Deliberation for Major Community Decisions and Policy Development*

---

Citizen assemblies provide a structured approach to democratic decision-making that combines random selection, expert testimony, and deliberative dialogue to address complex community challenges. Unlike traditional voting or town hall meetings, citizen assemblies create conditions for informed, thoughtful decision-making by representative groups of community members who have time to learn, discuss, and develop nuanced solutions to difficult questions.

## Understanding Citizen Assembly Principles

### What Makes Citizen Assemblies Effective

**Democratic Legitimacy Through Random Selection**
Citizen assemblies use random selection (sortition) rather than elections or volunteering to ensure representative participation.

*Why Random Selection Works:*
- **Eliminates Self-Selection Bias**: Avoids domination by the most vocal or politically active community members
- **Creates Representative Microcosm**: Random selection typically produces groups that reflect community demographics and perspectives
- **Reduces Political Pressure**: Participants aren't accountable to voters or special interests, enabling independent judgment
- **Encourages Fresh Perspectives**: Includes voices that might not participate in traditional political processes

*BAZ-Specific Selection Considerations:*
- **Stratified Sampling**: Ensure representation across age groups, household types, length of community membership, and work areas
- **Indigenous Sovereignty Respect**: If applicable, coordinate with Indigenous governance protocols and potentially separate selection processes
- **Accessibility Planning**: Accommodate different abilities, languages, childcare needs, and work schedules
- **Voluntary Participation**: While selection is random, participation remains voluntary with respectful opt-out processes

**Learning Before Deciding**
Citizen assemblies provide structured education before deliberation, unlike referendums where voters decide without systematic learning.

*Expert Testimony and Information Gathering:*
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Present diverse viewpoints including technical experts, community elders, and stakeholder representatives
- **Technical Literacy Development**: Help participants understand complex issues through accessible education rather than oversimplification
- **Values Clarification**: Help participants understand how different community values apply to the decision at hand
- **Options Analysis**: Present multiple potential solutions rather than simple yes/no choices

*BAZ-Specific Learning Integration:*
- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge**: Include Indigenous knowledge holders and ecological experts as learning resources
- **Bioregional Context**: Education about watershed health, ecosystem relationships, and long-term ecological implications
- **Economic Literacy**: Help participants understand Hearts/Leaves currency systems and alternative economic approaches
- **Seventh-Generation Thinking**: Frame decisions in terms of long-term community and ecological health

**Deliberative Quality Over Speed**
Citizen assemblies prioritize thoughtful discussion and relationship-building over rapid decision-making.

*Structured Deliberation Process:*
- **Small Group Discussion**: Mix participants across different tables or breakout groups to encourage diverse conversation
- **Facilitated Dialogue**: Professional facilitation ensuring all voices are heard while maintaining productive conversation
- **Multiple Rounds**: Several sessions over weeks or months allowing time for reflection and evolving understanding
- **Consensus Building**: Work toward solutions that address diverse concerns rather than simple majority rule

### When to Use Citizen Assemblies in BAZ Governance

**Constitutional and Charter Decisions**
Use citizen assemblies for fundamental community decisions that affect community structure and values.

*Appropriate Constitutional Questions:*
- **Community Charter Adoption**: Developing or revising fundamental community agreements and governance structures
- **Land Use Planning**: Major decisions about community development patterns and ecological stewardship approaches
- **Economic System Design**: Decisions about AUBI implementation, currency systems, and resource allocation principles
- **Relationship Agreements**: Decisions about municipal partnerships, external relationships, and growth management

*Integration with Other Governance Methods:*
- **Sociocratic Implementation**: Citizen assemblies develop policies that sociocratic circles implement through operational decisions
- **Traditional Council Coordination**: Where applicable, coordinate citizen assemblies with Indigenous governance protocols and elder councils
- **Community Ratification**: Citizen assembly recommendations may require broader community confirmation through referenda or consensus processes

**Complex Policy Development**
Use citizen assemblies for technical or controversial policy areas requiring extensive learning and diverse perspective integration.

*Policy Areas Suitable for Citizen Assemblies:*
- **Climate Adaptation Planning**: Community resilience strategies for climate change impacts and ecosystem shifts
- **Technology Integration**: Decisions about digital infrastructure, surveillance, artificial intelligence, and community technology approaches
