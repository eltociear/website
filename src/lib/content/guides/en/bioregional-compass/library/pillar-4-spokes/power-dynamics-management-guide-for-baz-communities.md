# Power Dynamics Management Guide for BAZ Communities

*Preventing Concentration of Power Through Systematic Leadership Development and Accountability*

---

Power dynamics in intentional communities require careful management to prevent the concentration of authority that can undermine democratic principles and community well-being. Without systematic approaches to leadership rotation, accountability structures, and succession planning, communities risk developing informal hierarchies, founder syndrome, or leadership burnout that threatens community sustainability. This guide provides comprehensive frameworks for managing power dynamics while maintaining effective governance and community leadership.

## Understanding Power Dynamics in Community Context

### Types of Power in BAZ Communities
