# Resource Planning Playbook - Overview

*Strategic Resource Management for Bioregional Community Development*

---

BAZ communities require careful resource planning across multiple dimensions - financial capital, human capacity, infrastructure development, and external relationships. Unlike conventional organizations focused primarily on financial metrics, regenerative communities must balance economic sustainability with ecological health, social equity, and cultural vitality. Without comprehensive resource planning, communities risk overextending capacity, creating dependency on extractive systems, or failing to develop the infrastructure needed for long-term success.

This playbook provides frameworks for strategic resource management that aligns investment with community values while building resilience and capacity for sustained growth and adaptation.

## Core Resource Planning Principles

### Regenerative Resource Philosophy

Resource planning must align with regenerative principles that prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term efficiency.

**Abundance vs. Scarcity Mindset:**
- Resource planning based on collaborative abundance rather than competitive scarcity
- Investment strategies that create shared value rather than extracting value from external sources
- Wealth distribution systems that strengthen community relationships and capacity
- Economic models that reward care work and ecological stewardship alongside material production

**Values-Aligned Investment:**
- Resource allocation decisions based on community values and mission alignment
- Investment approaches that strengthen rather than compromise community autonomy
- Financial strategies that reduce dependency on extractive economic systems
- Resource sharing and cooperative development that builds broader movement capacity

### Holistic Resource Assessment

Effective resource planning considers multiple forms of capital and their interconnections.

**Multiple Capital Framework:**
- **Financial Capital**: Money, investments, and economic resources available for community development
- **Human Capital**: Skills, knowledge, experience, and capacity of community members
- **Social Capital**: Relationships, networks, trust, and collaborative capacity
- **Natural Capital**: Land, water, ecosystems, and environmental resources
- **Cultural Capital**: Traditions, knowledge systems, artistic expressions, and meaning-making practices
- **Infrastructure Capital**: Buildings, technology, equipment, and physical systems

**Integrated Planning Approach:**
- Resource planning that considers interactions and trade-offs between different forms of capital
- Investment strategies that strengthen multiple forms of capital simultaneously
- Assessment of resource needs across all community functions and development phases
- Long-term planning that builds community resilience and regenerative capacity

### Risk Management and Resilience Building

Resource planning must address potential challenges while building capacity for adaptation and growth.

**Diversified Resource Strategy:**
- Multiple revenue streams and resource sources reducing dependence on single sources
- Flexible resource allocation systems enabling adaptation to changing circumstances
- Reserve funds and backup resources providing security during challenging periods
- Risk assessment and contingency planning for various potential challenges

**Community Resilience Integration:**
- Resource planning that strengthens community capacity to handle crises and challenges
- Investment in systems and skills that increase community self-sufficiency
- Network development providing mutual aid and support during difficult periods
- Learning and adaptation systems improving resource management based on experience

## Common Resource Planning Challenges

### The Founder's Resource Trap

**Problem:** Early community development depends heavily on founder resources and commitment, creating vulnerability when founders experience changes in capacity or priorities.

**Prevention:**
- Diversified resource development from community formation beginning
- Clear agreements about founder contributions and expectations over time
- Community capacity building reducing dependence on founder skills and resources
- Succession planning ensuring community sustainability beyond founder involvement

### The Grant Dependency Syndrome

**Problem:** Communities become dependent on external grant funding without developing sustainable internal revenue generation.

**Prevention:**
- Grant funding used for capacity building and infrastructure that enables long-term sustainability
- Diversified funding strategies including internal revenue generation from early development stages
- Grant applications aligned with community mission rather than funding availability driving community direction
- Financial planning that includes transition from grant dependency to internal sustainability

### The Infrastructure Investment Dilemma

**Problem:** Communities face pressure to invest heavily in infrastructure before developing the capacity to maintain and utilize it effectively.

**Prevention:**
- Phased infrastructure development aligned with community capacity and needs
- Investment in human capacity and skills development alongside physical infrastructure
- Infrastructure choices that can be maintained and modified by community members
- Financial planning that includes ongoing maintenance and operation costs rather than just initial capital costs

### The External Partnership Compromise

**Problem:** Resource constraints lead communities to accept partnerships and funding that compromise community values or autonomy.

**Prevention:**
- Clear community agreements about non-negotiable values and principles
- Partnership assessment criteria ensuring alignment with community mission
- Alternative resource development reducing pressure to accept inappropriate partnerships
- Community decision-making processes that resist resource pressure without adequate alignment assessment

- Equipment and tool sharing arrangements reducing individual community capital requirements
- Joint purchasing and development programs reducing costs through cooperative buying power

Resource planning is not about accumulating maximum resources, but about developing the right combination of financial, human, and relationship resources to achieve community mission while maintaining community values and autonomy. Success requires understanding that resource development is relationship development, and that the most valuable resources are often the capabilities and connections that enable communities to meet challenges and opportunities with creativity and collaboration.

The goal is building resource systems that strengthen community resilience and regenerative capacity while reducing dependence on extractive external systems. This requires careful planning that balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability, individual member needs with collective goals, and community autonomy with beneficial partnerships and relationships.

Remember that resource planning is an ongoing process rather than a one-time activity. Communities that regularly assess and adjust their resource strategies based on experience and changing circumstances are more likely to achieve long-term sustainability and success.
