# External Partnership Development & Relationship Management

*Building Strategic Relationships that Support Community Goals*

---

BAZ communities cannot achieve regenerative goals in isolation. Success requires developing strategic partnerships with other communities, organizations, government agencies, and professional networks while maintaining community autonomy and values alignment. However, external relationships also create risks - partnerships can compromise community mission, create dependencies, or lead to mission drift if not managed carefully. This guide provides frameworks for building relationships that strengthen rather than undermine community goals while contributing to broader regenerative transformation.

Partnership development is fundamentally about building the relationships necessary for regenerative community success while contributing to broader transformation toward sustainable and equitable social systems. Success requires understanding that partnerships are relationship investments that must be maintained and nurtured over time.

The goal is developing a network of relationships that provides community security, resources, and support while enabling community contribution to broader social change efforts. This requires careful partner selection, clear agreements and expectations, ongoing communication and conflict resolution, and integration of individual partnerships within broader network and movement building strategies.

Effective partnership development recognizes that community autonomy and interdependence are not contradictory but complementary - communities can maintain their values and decision-making independence while participating in collaborative relationships that strengthen both individual community capacity and collective movement impact.

Communities that develop strong partnership networks often find they are more resilient, have access to more resources and opportunities, and are able to achieve greater impact toward their regenerative goals than communities that attempt to operate in isolation.
