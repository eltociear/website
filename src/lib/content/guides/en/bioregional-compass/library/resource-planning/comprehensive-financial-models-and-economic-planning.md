# Comprehensive Financial Models & Economic Planning

*Building Economic Systems that Support Community Values*

---

BAZ communities require sophisticated financial planning that differs significantly from conventional business or organization budgeting. Community economic systems must balance immediate operational needs with long-term regenerative development, individual member financial health with collective resource stewardship, and community autonomy with necessary external economic relationships. This guide provides frameworks for developing financial models that support community values while ensuring economic sustainability.

## Understanding Community Economic Systems

### The Three-Layered Economy Model

BAZ communities operate across three interconnected economic layers, each requiring different planning approaches and financial management strategies.

**Fiat Currency Layer:**
- Traditional money used for external transactions, taxes, and regulatory compliance
- Bridge funding during community economic system development
- External relationship management and resource acquisition
- Legal and regulatory compliance costs including taxes, permits, and professional services

**Leaves Currency Layer:**
- Ecological value currency backed by measurable environmental improvements
- Rewards for ecosystem restoration, biodiversity enhancement, and ecological stewardship
- Local exchange medium for environmentally beneficial goods and services
- Investment in long-term ecological health and regenerative capacity

**Hearts Currency Layer:**
- Care and community value currency rewarding relationship building and social contribution
- Recognition for childcare, elder care, conflict resolution, and community cultural activities
- Local exchange medium for social services and community enrichment activities
- Investment in community well-being and social resilience

### Financial Planning Across Community Development Phases

**Pre-Formation Financial Assessment (6-12 months):**

Financial planning for regenerative communities requires understanding that economic systems are relationship systems. Success depends not only on accurate projections and careful budgeting, but on creating economic relationships that strengthen community bonds while providing the resources necessary for sustainable operations and continued development.

The goal is building economic systems that serve community values and member well-being rather than external profit maximization, while maintaining the financial sustainability necessary for long-term community success. This requires careful attention to both the technical aspects of financial management and the social and cultural aspects of cooperative economics.

Remember that community financial systems are learning systems that require ongoing assessment, adjustment, and improvement based on community experience and changing circumstances. Communities that embrace financial experimentation while maintaining careful planning and risk management often develop innovative economic approaches that contribute to broader movement learning and development.
