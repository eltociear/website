# Capacity Building Timelines & Human Development

*Developing Community Skills and Leadership for Long-term Success*

---

BAZ communities depend fundamentally on the knowledge, skills, and leadership capacity of their members. Unlike conventional organizations that can hire expertise as needed, regenerative communities must develop internal capacity across governance, technical systems, conflict resolution, ecological stewardship, and economic management. Without strategic human development planning, communities risk becoming dependent on founder knowledge, failing to develop essential skills, or losing institutional memory when key members leave.

This guide provides frameworks for systematic capacity building that develops community member skills while creating resilient knowledge systems and leadership structures.

Capacity building is fundamentally about creating learning communities where members grow individually while contributing to collective capability and resilience. Success requires understanding that human development is the foundation of all other community development - technical systems, financial resources, and external relationships are all dependent on community member capacity to manage them effectively.

The goal is building communities where members can develop their full potential while contributing to shared goals, where knowledge and skills are distributed broadly enough to prevent single points of failure, and where learning and development continue throughout community evolution and growth.

Community capacity building is most effective when it emerges from member interests and community needs simultaneously, when it includes both internal skill development and external learning opportunities, and when it creates systems for preserving and sharing knowledge across member transitions and community changes.
