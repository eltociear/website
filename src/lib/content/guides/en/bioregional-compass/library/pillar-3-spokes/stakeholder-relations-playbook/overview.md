Successful BAZ communities require positive relationships with external stakeholders who control critical services, regulatory approval, and community legitimacy. Without strategic stakeholder engagement, communities risk isolation, service disruption, regulatory hostility, or emergency response gaps that threaten community safety and sustainability. Professional stakeholder relations enable communities to demonstrate value while accessing essential services and building political protection.
