## Core Digital Commons Principles for BAZ Communities

### Community Ownership and Democratic Control

Digital Commons infrastructure must remain under community control with democratic decision-making about technology choices, data policies, and network relationships.

**Community Governance of Technology:**
- Democratic decision-making about technology adoption, data policies, and infrastructure development
- Community education and capacity building enabling informed participation in technology governance
- Distributed technical responsibility preventing concentration of digital power in few individuals
- Transparent technology choices with community understanding of benefits, costs, and risks

**Cooperative Technology Development:**
- Preference for open-source software and hardware that communities can modify and control
- Collaborative relationships with other communities and organizations for shared technology development
- Community contribution to broader Digital Commons through code, content, and resource sharing
- Technology choices that support rather than undermine community values and social relationships

### Privacy, Security, and Surveillance Resistance

BAZ communities require digital infrastructure that protects against surveillance, data extraction, and external control while enabling necessary communication and coordination.

**Security and Privacy Protection:**
- End-to-end encryption for community communications and sensitive information
- Decentralized storage and networking reducing dependence on corporate platforms and centralized services
- Quantum-resistant cryptography and forward-looking security protocols protecting against emerging threats
- Community education about digital security, privacy practices, and threat awareness

**Anti-Surveillance Infrastructure:**
- Mesh networking and local-first systems reducing dependence on internet infrastructure controlled by corporations and governments
- Anonymous and pseudonymous communication options protecting individual and community privacy
- Secure communication channels for coordination with allied communities and organizations
- Technical infrastructure designed to resist censorship, monitoring, and external interference

### Cultural Sovereignty and Indigenous Data Rights

Digital Commons implementation must respect Indigenous data sovereignty and support community cultural preservation and transmission.

**Indigenous Data Sovereignty Support:**
- Recognition of Indigenous authority over data about Indigenous communities, territories, and traditional knowledge
- Implementation of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0) protocols for any data sharing or research collaboration
- Support for Indigenous-controlled data infrastructure and governance systems
- Technical infrastructure that supports rather than undermines Indigenous cultural protocols and decision-making processes

**Community Cultural Preservation:**
- Digital archiving and preservation systems for community cultural materials, oral histories, and traditional knowledge
- Community-controlled access to cultural materials with appropriate protocols and restrictions
- Integration of traditional knowledge systems with digital infrastructure in respectful and appropriate ways
- Technology choices that support intergenerational knowledge transmission and cultural continuity

### Environmental Sustainability and Appropriate Technology

Digital Commons infrastructure must align with community environmental values through sustainable technology choices and resource use.

**Sustainable Technology Infrastructure:**
- Low-energy hardware and software choices reducing community environmental impact
- Renewable energy systems powering community digital infrastructure
- Lifecycle planning for technology hardware including repair, upgrade, and responsible disposal
- Technology choices that support rather than undermine community sustainability goals

**Appropriate Technology Selection:**
- Technology complexity appropriate to community technical capacity and maintenance capabilities
- Preference for robust, repairable technology over high-performance systems requiring frequent replacement
- Integration of digital systems with community physical infrastructure and social systems
- Technology choices that enhance rather than replace human relationships and community social fabric

## Integration with BAZ Community Development

### Digital Commons and Community Governance

Digital Commons infrastructure should support and strengthen community governance systems while enabling participation in broader networks.

**Governance Technology Integration:**
- Digital tools supporting community decision-making including voting systems, consensus processes, and information sharing
- Secure communication systems for community governance discussions and coordination
- Documentation and archiving systems preserving community governance decisions and institutional memory
- Technology infrastructure that supports rather than replaces face-to-face community relationship building

**External Network Participation:**
- Technical infrastructure enabling community participation in bioregional and global governance networks
- Secure communication channels for diplomatic and advocacy work with external stakeholders
- Community capacity for contributing to and benefiting from broader Digital Commons networks and resources
- Balance between local autonomy and global connectivity through appropriate technology and governance choices

### Economic Integration and Resource Sharing

Digital Commons can support community alternative economic systems while enabling participation in broader regenerative economy networks.

**Alternative Economic System Support:**
- Digital infrastructure supporting Hearts/Leaves currency systems and community exchange networks
- Secure systems for community resource sharing, project coordination, and mutual aid organization
- Integration with broader alternative economic networks while maintaining community control over economic data and decisions
- Technology choices that support cooperative and solidarity economy principles rather than extractive economic relationships

**Resource Sharing and Mutual Aid:**
- Communication and coordination systems for resource sharing between communities and allied organizations
- Digital infrastructure for organizing and coordinating mutual aid during emergencies and crises
- Systems for sharing technical knowledge, skills, and resources between communities developing Digital Commons infrastructure
- Community contribution to broader movement resources through sharing of innovations, lessons learned, and technical capacity

Digital Commons setup requires balancing technical sophistication with community capacity while prioritizing community ownership, security, and values alignment. Success depends on community education, democratic technology governance, and strategic integration with broader Digital Commons networks that support rather than compromise community autonomy and self-determination.

The goal is establishing digital infrastructure that serves community needs while contributing to broader movement building for decentralized, democratic, and regenerative digital systems. This requires ongoing attention to technology choices, security practices, and community capacity building that enables effective participation in Digital Commons networks while maintaining local control and cultural integrity.
