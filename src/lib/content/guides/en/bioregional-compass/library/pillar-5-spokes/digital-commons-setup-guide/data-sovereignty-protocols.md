# Data Sovereignty Protocols

*Implementing Community Control Over Data and Information Systems*

---

Data sovereignty enables communities to maintain control over their information, protect privacy and cultural knowledge, and participate in digital networks on their own terms. For BAZ communities, data sovereignty protocols provide essential protection against surveillance, data extraction, and cultural appropriation while enabling beneficial participation in Digital Commons networks and broader social movements. This guide provides comprehensive frameworks for implementing community-controlled data governance and technical infrastructure.

## Understanding Data Sovereignty Principles

Data sovereignty protocols enable BAZ communities to maintain control over their information and participate in digital networks on their own terms while protecting against surveillance, data extraction, and cultural appropriation. Success depends on combining technical infrastructure with community education and democratic governance ensuring that data sovereignty serves community values and supports community self-determination rather than creating new forms of technical hierarchy or exclusion.

The goal is implementing data sovereignty systems that protect community privacy and autonomy while enabling beneficial participation in Digital Commons networks and broader social movements. This requires ongoing attention to technical security, community education, and advocacy for legal frameworks that support rather than undermine community data sovereignty and democratic control of technology.
