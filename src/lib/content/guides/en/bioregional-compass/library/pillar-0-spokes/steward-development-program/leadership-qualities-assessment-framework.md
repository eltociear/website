# Leadership Qualities Assessment Framework

*Identifying and Cultivating Essential Stewardship Capacities*

Effective BAZ stewardship requires a unique combination of systems awareness, facilitative skills, and regenerative values that differs significantly from conventional leadership models. This assessment framework provides tools for evaluating and developing the five core steward qualities essential for regenerative community leadership.

## Comprehensive Assessment Process

### Self-Assessment Protocol

**Individual Reflection Process (2-3 hours over several days)**

*Preparation:*
- Set aside quiet time for honest self-reflection without interruption
- Review community experiences and leadership situations from past year
- Consider feedback received from other community members about leadership and contribution

*Assessment Completion:*
- Rate yourself on each indicator using 1-5 scale
- Identify 2-3 strongest areas and 2-3 areas needing development
- Write specific examples for assessment questions
- Consider which steward qualities come most naturally and which require more effort

*Goal Setting and Development Planning:*
- Choose 1-2 specific development areas for focused improvement over next 6-12 months
- Identify specific actions, learning opportunities, and practice areas for development
- Consider mentorship, training, or support needed for development goals
- Set measurable outcomes and timeline for assessing progress

### Peer Assessment and 360-Degree Feedback

**Community Member Feedback Process**

*Feedback Gathering Structure:*
- Request feedback from 4-6 community members who have observed your leadership in different contexts
- Include both peers and people you've worked with in leadership capacity
- Use structured feedback forms based on assessment indicators
- Request specific examples and suggestions for development

*Feedback Integration Process:*
- Compare peer feedback with self-assessment to identify blind spots and strengths
- Look for patterns across different feedback sources
- Identify areas where self-perception differs significantly from others' observations
- Use feedback to refine development goals and approach

*Community Learning Integration:*
- Share appropriate insights from assessment process with community (while maintaining privacy about sensitive feedback)
- Use assessment results to improve community leadership development and support systems
- Contribute to community understanding of effective stewardship qualities and development needs

## Leadership Development Planning

### Individual Development Planning Framework

**Development Goal Setting**

*SMART Goals for Steward Development:*
- **Specific:** Focus on particular steward quality or skill area
- **Measurable:** Include observable indicators and feedback sources
- **Achievable:** Match goals with current capacity and available support
- **Relevant:** Align with both individual growth interests and community needs
- **Time-bound:** Set realistic timeline with milestones for progress assessment

*Development Strategy Planning:*
- Identify learning approaches that match your learning style and preferences
- Balance formal training with experiential learning and practice opportunities
- Include mentorship, peer learning, and community practice in development plan
- Plan for both individual development activities and community contribution opportunities

**Progress Tracking and Evaluation**

*Regular Assessment and Adjustment:*
- Monthly self-reflection on development progress and challenges
- Quarterly check-ins with mentors or development partners
- Annual comprehensive assessment and development plan updating
- Integration of feedback from community members and leadership experiences

*Learning Documentation:*
- Keep development journal documenting insights, challenges, and breakthroughs
- Document specific examples of leadership growth and improved effectiveness
- Record lessons learned from leadership mistakes and difficulties
- Share appropriate learning with other developing stewards

### Community Readiness Assessment

**Leadership Role Readiness Evaluation**

*Readiness Indicators for Specific Community Roles:*
- Overall assessment score meets minimum requirements for role responsibility level
- Demonstrated competence in steward qualities most relevant to specific role
- Community member confidence and support for individual taking on leadership responsibility
- Individual commitment and availability for role requirements and timeline
- Support system and mentorship available for role success and development

*Community Leadership Capacity Planning:*
- Assessment of overall community leadership capacity and development needs
- Identification of leadership gaps and succession planning requirements
- Planning for leadership development activities and support systems
- Integration of individual development with community capacity building

This assessment framework works best when used as ongoing development tool rather than gatekeeping mechanism. The goal is supporting individual growth and community leadership capacity rather than excluding people from leadership opportunities.

Effective use requires community commitment to supporting leadership development and creating safe environments for honest self-assessment and peer feedback. Communities that invest in systematic steward development often find they have more resilient governance and more effective decision-making processes.
