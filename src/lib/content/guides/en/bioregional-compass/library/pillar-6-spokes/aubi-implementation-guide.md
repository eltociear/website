# AUBI Implementation Guide
*Treasury Setup, Payment Systems, and Community Work Team Organization*

---

The Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) system represents the economic heartbeat of a regenerative BAZ community, providing economic security while rewarding contributions to care, culture, and ecological restoration. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing AUBI's four-layer system, establishing community treasury operations, and organizing Community Work Teams that earn Hearts and Leaves currencies.

## Quick Start Checklist

**Before You Begin** (Prerequisites from other Pillars):
- [ ] Community governance structures established (Pillar 4)
- [ ] Basic digital infrastructure in place (Pillar 5)
- [ ] Legal framework for financial operations (Pillar 3)
- [ ] Community of at least 25-50 members ready to participate

**AUBI Launch Sequence** (3-6 months):
- [ ] Form Treasury Council and establish basic treasury operations
- [ ] Launch Layer 1 payments for 5-10 pilot households
- [ ] Set up Love Ledger system for contribution tracking
- [ ] Organize first Community Work Teams
- [ ] Begin Hearts/Leaves distribution for validated contributions
- [ ] Establish feedback loops and adjustment protocols

## Understanding the AUBI Four-Layer System

### Layer 0: Relational Wealth (Philosophical Foundation)
**Purpose:** Honors unmonetized contributions as the foundation of Right Relationship
**Implementation:** Cultural recognition without direct payment, transitional pathways to Layer 2

*Practical Example:* Elder Maria's storytelling circles are recorded in Love Ledger with Gratitude Tokens. At community gatherings, her contributions are acknowledged ceremonially. When she begins mentoring youth storytellers, this transitions to Layer 2 Hearts rewards.

### Layer 1: Universal Baseline 
**Purpose:** Ensures dignity with hybrid fiat/Hearts payments covering basic needs
**Coverage:** All community members 18+ (with youth civic internship options 16-18)
**Payment Structure:** 70% fiat, 30% Hearts initially (ratio adjustable by Treasury Council)

*Calculation Method:*
- Regional cost analysis: Housing (40%), food (25%), utilities (15%), transport (10%), healthcare (10%)
- Example: $1,200/month baseline = $840 fiat + 120 Hearts (at $3/Heart initial value)

### Layer 2: Contribution & Development Bonus
**Purpose:** Rewards validated contributions to Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
**Payment:** Hearts for care/cultural work, Leaves for ecological restoration
**Gaming Prevention:** AI anomaly detection, community audits, 5% annual contribution decay

*Contribution Categories:*
- **Love (Hearts):** Caregiving (10 Hearts/hour), mentorship (15 Hearts/session), conflict resolution (20 Hearts/case)
- **Meaning (Hearts):** Cultural preservation (12 Hearts/hour), knowledge sharing (8 Hearts/workshop), spiritual care (15 Hearts/ceremony)
- **Connection (Leaves):** Ecosystem restoration adjusted by Green Job Score (1.0x-1.5x multiplier set by Fractal Labor Parliament)

### Layer 3: Equity & Needs-Based Bonus
**Purpose:** Addresses historical injustices and additional needs
**Coverage:** Disability support, caregiving responsibilities, geographic equity, reparations
**Payment:** Hearts with Earth Council oversight for cultural/ecological violations

## Treasury Setup and Management

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### Economic Challenges

**Insufficient Community Resources**
- *Problem:* Not enough fiat reserves to maintain Layer 1 payments
- *Solutions:* Temporary reduction to Hearts-only payments, community fundraising campaign, seek external grants, establish fee-for-service Work Team contracts with external organizations

**Hearts Inflation/Devaluation**
- *Problem:* Too many Hearts issued relative to community real value creation
- *Solutions:* Adjust contribution rates downward, implement temporary issuance caps, increase reserve backing requirements, community audit of contribution validation standards

**Low Work Team Participation**
- *Problem:* Community members not engaging with Work Teams or contribution systems
- *Solutions:* Simplify participation processes, provide more training and support, adjust contribution rates upward, address cultural barriers to participation, provide childcare and accessibility support

### Social and Cultural Challenges

**Contribution Validation Disputes**
- *Problem:* Community conflicts over whether contributions deserve Hearts/Leaves rewards
- *Solutions:* Clearer contribution standards, additional training for validators, mediation support for disputes, community dialogue about values and priorities

**Elite Capture or Gaming**
- *Problem:* Some community members exploiting systems to earn disproportionate rewards
- *Solutions:* Enhanced community auditing, algorithmic anomaly detection, contribution caps for high earners, cultural education about community values and mutual aid principles

**Cultural Appropriation Concerns**
- *Problem:* Work Team activities or validation systems inappropriate relative to Indigenous protocols
- *Solutions:* Enhanced cultural training, Indigenous consultation on system design, stronger Earth Council oversight, revision of validation standards based on cultural feedback

### Technical and Operational Challenges

**Love Ledger Technical Problems**
- *Problem:* Software failures, data loss, or security breaches affecting contribution tracking
- *Solutions:* Backup systems, technical support contracts, community technical training, simplified paper-based backup systems

**Treasury Management Difficulties**
- *Problem:* Inadequate financial management skills, compliance issues, or accounting errors
- *Solutions:* Professional development for Treasury Council, mentorship relationships with experienced cooperatives, simplified accounting systems, external accounting support

**Integration with External Systems**
- *Problem:* Difficulties interfacing with banks, government agencies, or other external organizations
- *Solutions:* Legal support for compliance issues, partnership development with sympathetic external organizations, advocacy for policy changes, alternative institution development

This AUBI Implementation Guide provides communities with practical tools for establishing regenerative economic systems that support human flourishing while rewarding contributions to care, culture, and ecological restoration. Success requires combining technical implementation with community education, cultural sensitivity, and ongoing adaptation based on community feedback and changing circumstances.

The goal is creating economic security and abundance that enables community members to contribute their gifts while ensuring everyone's basic needs are met through the AUBI foundation. This economic system serves community flourishing rather than profit extraction, creating the material foundation for BAZ communities to demonstrate viable alternatives to current economic systems.
