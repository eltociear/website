Internal conflicts and governance crises pose existential threats to BAZ communities by undermining the social trust and democratic processes essential for alternative community formation. This guide provides concrete protocols for preventing, de-escalating, and resolving internal community conflicts while maintaining democratic values and protecting vulnerable community members.

## Understanding Internal Community Conflicts

### Root Causes of Community Conflicts

**Power Dynamics and Leadership Issues**
- Informal power concentration despite democratic structures
- Leadership burnout leading to authoritarian or withdrawn behavior

**Decision-Making and Governance Process Failures**
- Democratic fatigue leading to low participation and informal decision-making
- Consensus process breakdowns when community members have irreconcilable differences
- Information sharing failures creating suspicion and misunderstanding

- External pressure creating internal stress and reactive decision-making

### Conflict Escalation Patterns

**Stage 4: Crisis and Potential Community Dissolution**
