# Village to Bioregional Transition Guide
*From Community Organization to Regional Network (500-5000+ people)*

---

The transition from village-scale (50-500 people) to bioregional-scale (500-5000+ people) represents a fundamental shift from single-community operation to multi-community coordination and regional influence. This transition requires developing capacity for watershed-scale ecological restoration, regional economic integration, and political engagement while maintaining democratic values and community identity across multiple sites.
