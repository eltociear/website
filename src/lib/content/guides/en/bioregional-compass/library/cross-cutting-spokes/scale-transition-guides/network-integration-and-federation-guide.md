This Network Integration and Federation Guide provides communities with frameworks for participating in civilizational transformation while maintaining democratic values and community identity. Success requires sophisticated strategic planning, significant capacity building, and integration with global movements while preserving the community values and practices that provide the foundation for planetary transformation.

The scale transition from homestead to global network represents a journey from local experiment to civilizational transformation, maintaining democratic participation and ecological values across scales. This requires continuous attention to governance innovation, economic system development, and cultural preservation while building capacity for planetary-scale impact and regeneration.
