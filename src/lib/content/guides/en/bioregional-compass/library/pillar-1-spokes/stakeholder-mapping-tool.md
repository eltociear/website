# Stakeholder Mapping Tool

*Identifying and Engaging Diverse Community Voices*

---

Effective community development requires understanding and engaging the full spectrum of people and organizations that affect or are affected by community decisions and activities. Without systematic stakeholder identification and engagement, communities risk missing important perspectives, creating unintended opposition, or failing to build the relationships necessary for long-term success. This tool provides frameworks for mapping stakeholders, analyzing relationships, and developing engagement strategies that support inclusive community development.

Stakeholder mapping is an ongoing process rather than one-time analysis. Community circumstances, stakeholder interests, and relationship dynamics change over time, requiring regular assessment and strategy adjustment to maintain effective engagement and support for community development.

The goal is developing comprehensive understanding of community relationship landscape that enables strategic engagement supporting both community autonomy and positive relationships with diverse stakeholders. This requires balancing community values and independence with respect for legitimate stakeholder interests and concerns.

Effective stakeholder engagement often becomes one of the most important factors in community success, providing support during challenges, resources for development, and political protection for community innovations and alternative approaches to living and governance.
