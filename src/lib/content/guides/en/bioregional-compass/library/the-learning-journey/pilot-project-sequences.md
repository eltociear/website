# Pilot Project Sequences

*Learning by Doing: Strategic Project Selection for BAZ Development*

---

Theory without practice breeds idealism. Practice without theory breeds chaos. Pilot projects bridge this gap, allowing communities to test BAZ principles in low-risk, high-learning environments while building practical capacity for larger transformations.

The key to successful pilot projects is not perfection but strategic learning. Each project should teach you something essential about governance, economics, ecology, or community dynamics while producing tangible benefits that sustain momentum.

## The Strategic Logic of Pilot Sequencing

### **Risk-Graduated Learning**

Start with projects that have high learning potential but low failure consequences. A failed community garden teaches valuable lessons about collaboration and resource management without threatening anyone's housing or livelihood. A failed attempt at alternative currency for essential services could leave vulnerable community members without critical support.

**Risk Assessment Framework:**
- **Green Light Projects:** Failure affects only volunteers and doesn't threaten basic needs
- **Yellow Light Projects:** Failure affects wider community but doesn't create lasting harm
- **Red Light Projects:** Failure could threaten housing, health, safety, or legal standing

### **Capacity Building Progression**

Each pilot should build specific organizational capacities needed for later, more complex initiatives:

**Foundation Capacities (Year 1):**
- Group decision-making and conflict resolution
- Basic project management and resource coordination
- External relationship building and communication
- Financial management and transparent accounting

**Intermediate Capacities (Years 2-3):**
- Multi-stakeholder collaboration and negotiation
- Complex resource flows and economic coordination
- Legal compliance and regulatory navigation
- Crisis management and adaptive problem-solving

**Advanced Capacities (Years 3+):**
- Inter-community coordination and mutual aid
- Policy advocacy and institutional engagement
- Innovation development and knowledge transfer
- Long-term strategic planning and adaptation

### **Integration and Synergy**

Later pilots should build on and integrate with earlier ones, creating synergistic systems rather than isolated projects. A tool library connects with repair workshops, which connect with skills-sharing networks, which connect with alternative currency systems.

## Foundation Sequence (Years 1-2): Building Basic Capacity

### **Pilot 1: Community Resource Sharing**

**Examples:**

**Common Challenges and Solutions:**

*Challenge:* Free-riding - some people take resources without contributing
*Solution:* Gentle accountability systems, contribution tracking, private conversations with non-contributors

*Challenge:* Resource management - tools disappear, plants die, workshops poorly attended
*Solution:* Simple check-out systems, shared maintenance schedules, survey participants about interests and timing

*Challenge:* Decision-making bottlenecks - small group making all decisions

## Pilot Project Design Principles

### **Start Small, Learn Big**

Every pilot should be designed for maximum learning rather than maximum impact. A small but successful project that teaches you about community decision-making is worth more than a large project that succeeds through individual heroism.

**Scale Appropriately:**
- Begin with 5-10 committed participants
- Focus on specific, measurable outcomes
- Plan for 3-6 month initial phases with evaluation and adaptation
- Build expansion capacity gradually based on lessons learned

### **Document Everything**

The value of pilot projects multiplies when lessons learned can be shared with other communities. Document not just what happened, but why you made specific choices, what you learned from mistakes, and what you would do differently.

**Documentation Framework:**
- **Project Design:** Why you chose this project and how you planned implementation
- **Process Notes:** Regular reflections on what's working and what isn't
- **Outcome Evaluation:** Quantitative and qualitative assessment of results
- **Lessons Learned:** Specific insights that could guide future projects
- **Resource Requirements:** Actual costs in time, money, and community capacity

### **Build on Success, Learn from Failure**

Not every pilot will succeed, and that's valuable information. The goal is to fail safely while learning quickly, building organizational capacity for more complex future work.

**Success Integration:**
- Expand successful pilots gradually while maintaining quality
- Connect successful projects to each other for synergistic benefits
- Use success stories to build community confidence and external support
- Celebrate achievements to maintain momentum and morale

**Failure Recovery:**
- Conduct honest evaluation without blame or defensiveness
- Identify specific lessons that can prevent similar failures
- Ensure failure doesn't harm vulnerable community members
- Use failure insights to design better future projects

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### **The Hero Trap**

**Problem:** Projects succeed because of one person's extraordinary effort rather than sustainable community systems.

**Prevention:**
- Design projects to require collaboration from the beginning
- Rotate leadership responsibilities regularly
- Build redundancy so projects can survive key people stepping back
- Celebrate collective achievements rather than individual contributions

### **The Scope Creep Trap**

**Problem:** Simple pilots expand beyond community capacity, leading to burnout or failure.

**Prevention:**
- Define clear project boundaries and stick to them
- Build expansion phases as separate projects with separate planning
- Regular evaluation of whether project demands match available capacity
- Permission to scale back or pause when sustainability is threatened

### **The Perfect Solution Trap**

**Problem:** Waiting to begin until you have the perfect project design.

**Prevention:**
- Plan for iteration and adaptation from the beginning
- Start with "good enough" solutions that can be improved through experience
- Set specific timelines for beginning implementation regardless of perfect planning
- Celebrate learning and adaptation as success rather than failure

The pilot project sequence is your community's laboratory for discovering what works in your specific context. Each project builds capacity, strengthens relationships, and provides evidence for the larger transformation ahead.

Remember: You're not just testing individual projects—you're building the organizational culture and practical skills that will allow your community to thrive as a fully operational BAZ.

*Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Learn as you go.*
