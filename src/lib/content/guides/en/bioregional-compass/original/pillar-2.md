## ## Pillar 2: Finding Our Place - Defining the Bioregion

With a shared vision as your spark, the next step is to define the "where." A Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) is not defined by old political lines on a colonial map, but by the living contours of the land and the cultural memory it holds. This pillar guides your community through the process of mapping your home as a living system, creating a new map written by the water, the wildlife, and the wisdom of ancestors.

### **Step 1: The Ecological Layer - Mapping the Flows of Life**

The foundation of your bioregion is its ecology. This mapping process is best done with local ecologists, geographers, and long-time residents who know the land intimately. Your goal is to understand the natural systems that define your place.

* **Follow the Water:** Map the watersheds in your area. Trace the creeks and streams that flow into larger rivers. A watershed is often the most natural and fundamental boundary of a bioregion.
* **Identify Ecosystems and Habitats:** Map the distinct ecological zones. Where are the forests, the wetlands, the grasslands? Where are the critical habitats for key local species (e.g., migration corridors for deer, nesting grounds for birds)?
* **Understand the Geology:** Map the underlying landforms—the valleys, mountains, and plains that shape how life moves and settles in your region.

### **Step 2: The Cultural Layer - Mapping Stories and Sovereignty**

A bioregion is not just an ecological zone; it is a landscape of human meaning, memory, and sovereignty. This layer must be mapped with deep respect and in collaboration with historians, cultural leaders, and especially the Indigenous communities of the area.

* **Honor Indigenous Territories:** The first and most important cultural layer is the map of traditional Indigenous territories. This process must be guided by and defer to the sovereignty of the local Indigenous nations, in alignment with the principles of the **`Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework`**. Their understanding of the land is foundational.
* **Identify Sacred and Historical Sites:** Map the places of collective memory—ancient burial grounds, sacred groves, historic battlefields, the first community settlements. These are the anchors of your region's story.
* **Map the "Foodshed":** Understand where your community's food comes from. Map the local farms, dairies, ranches, and wild harvesting areas that sustain you. This defines your "foodshed," a critical sub-region of your BAZ.

### **Step 3: Synthesizing the Layers - Weaving the Map**

The true map of your bioregion emerges when you overlay the ecological and cultural layers. This is a powerful community workshop activity. Project the different maps on top of one another and see where the boundaries align. You will often find that traditional Indigenous territories align closely with major watersheds, or that historical settlements are located in specific ecological niches. This synthesized map, created by the community, is the true definition of your bioregion.

### **Step 4: Defining the Initial "Zone of Governance"**

A full bioregion can be vast. It is often impractical to establish a BAZ across the entire territory at once. The final step is to define a smaller, manageable **initial Zone of Governance** within the larger bioregion.

This could be a single watershed, a specific valley, or the area encompassing a few local towns. The key is to choose a starting area where there is strong community energy and a clear, shared identity. The BAZ can then grow organically over time as its success inspires neighboring communities to join.
