## ## Pillar 6: Igniting the Engine - Economic Sovereignty

With your vision, map, legal structure, governance, and GGF integrations in place, you have built a powerful vessel. This final pillar is about igniting its engine. It's the moment your BAZ transitions from planning to practice, activating a regenerative economy where value flows to what truly matters: the health of your community and your land.

---
### **Step 1: Launch AUBI Layer 1 - The Foundation of Security**

The first step is to establish the economic safety net for every member of your BAZ. By implementing **Layer 1** of the **`AUBI Framework`**, you provide an unconditional basic income. This foundational security liberates community members from survival anxiety, giving them the freedom and stability to participate meaningfully in the regenerative work of the BAZ.

---
### **Step 2: Charter the First Community Work Teams**

With the foundation of security in place, the community can now self-organize into **Community Work Teams**, the core operational units of the **`Work in Liberation Framework`**. These are not jobs assigned from the top down; they are passion-driven groups formed to meet the real needs identified by the community in earlier pillars.

Initial teams often include:
* **The Ecosystem Restoration Team:** Focused on rewilding projects, watershed cleanup, and soil regeneration.
* **The Cultural Stewardship Team:** Focused on preserving local heritage, digitizing archives, and running intergenerational workshops.
* **The Community Care Team:** Focused on elder care, childcare, and mental health support.

---
### **Step 3: Activate the Love Ledger - Rewarding What Matters**

This is where the new value system comes online. The Community Work Teams begin to log their contributions on the BAZ's instance of the **`Love Ledger`**.

* **Ecological work** (e.g., planting trees) is verified and rewarded with **`Leaves`** currency.
* **Social and cultural care work** (e.g., mentoring youth) is verified and rewarded with **`Hearts`** currency.

This is the activation of **AUBI Layer 2**, making tangible the principle that caring for each other and the planet is the most valuable work there is.

---
### **Step 4: Establish the BAZ Treasury and Local Exchange**

To manage these new flows of value, your BAZ establishes its own **Treasury**, overseen by your "Common Good" or Economy Circle. This Treasury will manage funds from **Stewardship Bonds** and other sources, and it will support a local exchange where `Hearts` and `Leaves` can be traded for local goods and services, kickstarting a vibrant, circular, and sovereign local economy.

---
### **Step 5: Celebrate, Learn, and Iterate**

Launching your regenerative economy is a monumental achievement. It is essential to celebrate this milestone with a community-wide event that honors the work of every member. This celebration also marks the beginning of a new phase: ongoing learning and adaptation. Establish regular community forums to discuss what's working with the new economy, what challenges are arising, and how you can collectively adapt and improve your systems over time.

---
### **Step 6: Building the Bridge Economy**

A BAZ economy does not replace the fiat economy overnight. This crucial final step involves building a "bridge" that allows your community to meet its existing financial obligations (rent, taxes, groceries) while growing the internal regenerative economy.
