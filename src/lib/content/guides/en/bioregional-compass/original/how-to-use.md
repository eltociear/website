## **How to Use This Guide: An Iterative and Scalable Approach**

This guide presents six pillars in a logical sequence, but the journey of forming a BAZ is not a straight line. It is an **iterative, living process**. Your community will cycle back through earlier pillars as you learn and grow. The legal work of Pillar 3 may reshape the vision of Pillar 1. The economic realities of Pillar 6 may require you to revisit the governance models of Pillar 4.

Furthermore, these recommendations are **scale-sensitive**. A BAZ of 50 people will have different needs than one of 5,000. We will provide notes on how to adapt the strategies for different community sizes. Treat this guide as a compass, not a rigid map.

## **Choosing Your Pathway: Differentiated Tracks for BAZ Formation**

The journey to a BAZ is not one-size-fits-all. The strategies in this guide should be adapted to the scale of your ambition. We outline three common pathways:

* **Track 1: The "Homestead" Model (Micro-BAZ: <100 people):** Suited for intentional communities or small land co-ops. Focus is on informal or sociocratic governance, simpler legal structures (like a cooperative), and a highly integrated local economy.
* **Track 2: The "Village" Model (Meso-BAZ: 100 - 5,000 people):** For a small town, neighborhood, or a network of communities. Requires more formal governance (citizen assemblies), a public treasury, and formal "Sovereign Co-Stewardship Agreements" with local municipalities.
* **Track 3: The "Bioregional" Model (Macro-BAZ: 5,000+ people):** The full vision, covering an entire watershed or ecosystem. Requires sophisticated legal personhood, a formal relationship with the national government, and a robust, multi-layered internal economy.

Throughout this guide, we will provide specific notes for how to adapt the advice for your chosen track.
