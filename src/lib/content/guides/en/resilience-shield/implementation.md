# Implementation: From Decision to Reality

## The Problem with Implementation

Most security programs don't fail because they are poorly designed. They fail because they are never implemented.

**Why?**

1. **Bureaucratic Inertia:** "We need to investigate this for 18 months first."
2. **Silos:** No one wants to take the first step without knowing others will follow.
3. **Fear of Failure:** Politicians don't want to be the first to test something new.
4. **Lack of Resources:** "We have no budget for this."

The Resilience Shield is designed to bypass all these obstacles.

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Decision Making (Month 1-2)

**Who needs to make decisions?**

* The Municipal Council (KF) to establish The Resilience Fund.
* The Municipal Executive Board (KS) to establish the Coordination Council.
* No other decisions are initially required.

**What needs to be decided?**

**Decision 1: Establish the Local Resilience Fund**

```text
Draft Decision:
"The Municipal Council decides that as of [date], 0.1% 
of the municipality's annual procurement budget shall automatically be allocated to 
a separate account designated 'Local Resilience Fund'. The fund is managed 
by the Coordination Council established pursuant to decision [X]."

```

**Decision 2: Establish the Coordination Council**

```text
Draft Decision:
"The Municipal Executive Board decides to establish a Coordination Council for 
crisis management consisting of 8 members according to the following distribution:
- 2 seats: Municipal Leadership
- 2 seats: Police and Emergency Services
- 2 seats: Civil Society
- 2 seats: Youth Council (18-25 years)

The Council has the authority to:
1. Decide on the use of the Resilience Fund within given frameworks
2. Activate Community Teams when needed
3. Create a common operational picture between authorities
4. Conduct evaluations after crises"

```

**Legal Basis:**

* The Social Services Act (2001:453)
* The Civil Protection Act (2003:778)
* The Planning and Building Act (2010:900)

These laws already grant municipalities the authority to do this. Nothing new needs to be invented.

**Timeline for Decisions:**

* Week 1-2: Prepare proposals for KF/KS
* Week 3-4: Presentation in preparatory committees
* Week 5-6: Decision in KF/KS
* Week 7-8: Administrative implementation

### Phase 2: Structure Building (Month 3-6)

**Step 1: Recruit the Coordination Council**

**Municipal Leadership (2 seats):**

* 1 civil servant from the finance department
* 1 civil servant from the security department

**Police and Emergency Services (2 seats):**

* 1 local police contact (not operational chief)
* 1 representative from emergency services

**Civil Society (2 seats):**

* 1 representative from local associations (elected via open forum)
* 1 representative from religious communities (if relevant in the area)

**Youth Council (2 seats):**

* 2 young people aged 18-25
* Recruitment via schools, youth centers, and social media
* Requirement: No ongoing investigation for serious violence

**How to recruit youth representatives?**

* Open call via social media and schools
* Application with motivation (max 500 words)
* Selection by the other members of the Coordination Council
* Term: 2 years (for continuity)

**Step 2: Establish Technical Infrastructure**

**Common Operational Picture:**

* Use existing GIS systems (Geographic Information Systems)
* Integration with police systems (within data protection frameworks)
* Visualization on a shared screen in the Coordination Council's meeting room
* Cost: 100,000 - 300,000 SEK (one-time cost)

**Communication System:**

* Encrypted messaging group for the council
* Emergency phone that works even during power outages
* Backup communication via amateur radio (volunteers)
* Cost: 50,000 SEK (one-time cost)

**Documentation System:**

* Digital platform to log decisions and results
* Public part (transparency) and secure part (sensitive information)
* Use existing e-service platform if possible
* Cost: 0 - 100,000 SEK depending on existing infrastructure

**Step 3: Pilot Project with Community Teams**

**Identify Pilot Area:**

* Choose 1-2 districts/areas with:
* Highest youth unemployment
* Identified security challenges
* Active civil society that can support



**Recruit Mentors (3-5 people):**

* Former teachers, youth leaders, veterans
* Requirement: Approved security clearance
* Compensation: 15,000 - 20,000 SEK/month
* Cost: 60,000 - 100,000 SEK/month total

**Recruit First Cohort (20-30 youths):**

* Information via schools (grades 8-9)
* Information via social services
* Open recruitment via social media
* Requirement: Residency within the pilot area, aged 15-25
* Compensation: See detailed structure in "Community Teams"

**Budget for Pilot Project (12 months):**

* Mentors: 720,000 - 1,200,000 SEK
* Youth Compensation (25 people × 3000 SEK × 12 months): 900,000 SEK
* Materials and Training: 200,000 SEK
* **Total: 1,820,000 - 2,300,000 SEK**

**Funding:**
For a municipality with a procurement budget of 2 billion SEK:

* 0.1% allocation = 2,000,000 SEK/year
* This covers the pilot project with a margin

### Phase 3: Scaling and Evaluation (Month 7-12)

**Month 7-9: First Evaluation**

* How many youths completed the entire rite of passage?
* Was any reduction in youth crime measured?
* How did the youths and mentors experience the process?
* What adjustments are needed?

**Month 10-12: Scaling**
If the pilot project shows positive results:

* Expand to another 1-2 areas
* Recruit more mentors
* Increase the number of spots in Community Teams

If the pilot project shows mixed results:

* Adjust the model based on lessons learned
* Test modified version in the same area
* Continue learning systematically

**Transparency:**

* Publish all results (both successes and failures)
* Contribute to The Resilience Shield's global knowledge base
* Let other municipalities learn from your experience

## Common Obstacles and How to Bypass Them

### Obstacle 1: "We have no budget"

**Answer:** You already have the budget. 0.1% of the procurement budget is money you are already spending. You are simply reallocating it.

**Comparison:**

* Cost for one young person in a Community Team: 36,000 SEK/year
* Cost for one young person in prison: 1,095,000 SEK/year
* **Savings per person avoiding prison: 1,059,000 SEK**

If Community Teams prevent just **2 people** from ending up in prison per year, you have already saved the entire program's cost.

### Obstacle 2: "This is politically controversial"

**Answer:** It doesn't have to be.

**The Left will like:**

* Investment in preventive work
* Financial support for youth
* Cooperation with civil society

**The Right will like:**

* Reduced crime
* Local autonomy (less dependence on the state)
* Responsibility and the value of citizenship

**Everyone will like:**

* Concrete results
* Transparency
* Measurable effects

This is not ideology. This is engineering.

### Obstacle 3: "What if gangs sabotage?"

**Answer:** Gangs don't want their recruits to have alternatives. They will not actively try to participate in Community Teams.

**But if infiltration occurs:**

* Mentors are vetted carefully
* Team members who commit crimes during the rite of passage are expelled immediately
* Compensation must be repaid upon expulsion
* Transparent reporting makes it difficult to hide abuse

### Obstacle 4: "We need central approval"

**Answer:** No, you don't.

Municipalities already have the authority to:

* Manage their own budget
* Establish councils and forums
* Run youth activities
* Coordinate crisis management

This is not a new program. This is the use of existing powers in a more coordinated way.
