# Overview: How the Three Mechanisms Work Together

## The Synthesis Shaft Model

Traditional security solutions work linearly: detect problem → react → return to pre-state.

The Resilience Shield works **systemically**: build preventive capability → detect early signals → adapt continuously.

The three mechanisms work as an interconnected system:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS (The Hardware)        │
│   Common operational picture between all actors     │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## The Roles of the Mechanisms

### 1. Crisis Management Protocols (The Hardware)

**What it is:** A Coordination Council that breaks the silos between police, social services, economy, and civil society.

**What it does:**

* Creates a common operational picture in real-time.
* Coordinates resources between authorities.
* Activates crisis management without waiting for central directives.
* Conducts systematic learning after every incident.

**Why it works:** Gangs already have a "common operational picture" - they know where the police are, when social services come, which youths are vulnerable. The state must acquire the same capability.

### 2. Local Resilience Fund (The Nerves)

**What it is:** A self-financed reserve (0.1% of the procurement budget) that can be used for preventive initiatives without bureaucracy.

**What it does:**

* Funds community teams directly.
* Creates economic incentives for constructive behavior.
* Acts as insurance when the crisis hits.
* Avoids preventive work being cut during budget crises.

**Why it works:** Gangs can offer 10,000 SEK for a mission the same day. Social services can offer the possibility of an internship in 6 months after an investigation. This must be balanced.

### 3. Community Teams (The Heart)

**What it is:** Structured "rites of passage" that give youths identity, meaning, and concrete skills.

**What it does:**

* Offers an alternative to gang initiation.
* Creates trust between youth and society.
* Builds concrete competence (first aid, firefighting, IT security).
* Gives recognition and status for constructive contributions.

**Why it works:** Youths don't seek gangs for money primarily - they seek belonging, identity, and tasks that are bigger than themselves. We must offer this.

## Why This Is Not "Just Another Initiative"

There are already hundreds of "preventive programs." Why would this be different?

**Traditional programs:**

* Fragmented (each authority runs its own).
* Reactive (starts after the problem is visible).
* Voluntary (participation relies on motivation).
* Short-term (project support for 1-3 years).

**The Resilience Shield:**

* **Systematic** - all three mechanisms must work together.
* **Proactive** - builds infrastructure before the crisis.
* **Structural** - integrated into the municipality's ordinary operations.
* **Long-term** - self-financing through the resilience fund.

## Practical Example

**Scenario:** Signals of escalation in the Rosengård district.

**Traditional response:**

1. Police increase presence (reactive).
2. Social services start investigations (slow).
3. Media reports (escalates tensions).
4. Politicians debate (polarization).

**The Resilience Shield:**

1. The Crisis Management Council detects early signals from multiple sources simultaneously.
2. Local Resilience Fund is mobilized for acute intervention.
3. Community Teams with local grounding are activated for dialogue.
4. Resources are reallocated based on data-driven situational picture.
5. After stabilization: systematic learning process.

## Background

This framework is based on **Global Governance Frameworks** (GGF), an international system designed to function in areas from climate disasters to conflict zones.

We have adapted it for Swedish conditions.

It works because it doesn't require people to become "better." It builds systems that make it easier to do right and harder to do wrong.
