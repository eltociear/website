# The Local Resilience Fund: The Nerves of the System

## The Problem the Fund Solves

**Preventive work always comes last.**

When budgets are tightened, youth programs are cut first. When a crisis is already here, no money remains for rapid interventions. Politicians promise initiatives, but the procurement cycle takes 18 months.

Gangs can give a young person 10,000 SEK for a mission the same evening.

The state can offer an internship in 6 months after three investigations.

**Which actor do you think wins the battle for loyalty?**

## What the Resilience Fund Is

A **self-financed reserve** that you create by automatically allocating 0.1% of the municipality's annual procurement budget to a separate account.

### How Large Will the Fund Be?

For a medium-sized Swedish municipality:

* Procurement budget: 2 billion SEK/year
* 0.1% allocation: **2 million SEK/year**
* After 5 years: **10 million SEK in buffer**

This is not a new tax. This is not money taken from someone else. This is **internal prioritization** of a margin that most municipalities already lose on inefficient procurements.

## How the Fund Works

### 1. Automatic Supply

Every time the municipality procures a service, 0.1% of the amount goes directly to the Resilience Fund. No voting. No discussion. Automatically.

**Why?** Because preventive work is cut in budget negotiations. By making it automatic, you avoid that trap.

### 2. Independent Management

The fund is managed by a **Coordination Council** (see Crisis Management Protocols) with representatives from:

* Municipal Leadership (25%)
* Police and Security (25%)
* Civil Society (25%)
* Youth Council (25%)

**Why?** No single actor can use the fund for their own gain. Consensus is required.

### 3. Three Areas of Use

**A. Community Teams (70% of annual budget)**

* Pays compensation to youths participating in rites of passage
* Funds materials and training
* Creates concrete economic incentives for constructive behavior

**B. Crisis Management Infrastructure (20%)**

* Common data platform for situational picture
* Training of coordination staff
* Communication systems that work when the power grid fails

**C. Acute Crisis Management (10%)**

* Reserve for unforeseen events
* Rapid interventions when the situation escalates
* Can be activated within 24 hours without ordinary decision-making processes

### 4. Transparency and Accountability

All use of the fund is logged publicly:

* Where did the money go?
* What results were achieved?
* What lessons were learned?

This is done through a suitable transparent system where citizens can follow every transaction.

## Why This Is Not Corruption or Waste

**Objection 1:** "The youths will just take the money without doing anything."

**Answer:** Compensation is paid out only after verified performance (see Community Teams). If someone cheats, it is immediately visible in the transparent system.

**Objection 2:** "This is new money out of thin air."

**Answer:** It is existing money being reallocated. You are already paying for the enforcement authority, police, social services, trials, prison. These costs decrease when you prevent.

**Objection 3:** "0.1% is too little to make a difference."

**Answer:** For a medium-sized municipality, this becomes 2 million SEK/year. Gangs recruit youths for 5000 SEK/month. For 2 million, you can offer structured employment to 400 youths for a whole year.

**Objection 4:** "What happens if the crisis doesn't come?"

**Answer:** Then you have built a buffer that can be used for other societal needs - as long as the Coordination Council approves and it is logged transparently.

## Concrete Example

**Malmö Municipality implements the Resilience Fund:**

**Year 1:**

* Allocation: 2 million SEK
* Usage: 1.5 million for Community Teams, 0.5 million for situational picture system
* Result: 300 youths complete the first rite of passage

**Year 3:**

* The Fund: 6 million in buffer
* Crisis: Storm Ivar knocks out the power grid for 48 hours
* Crisis Management: Community Teams are activated to distribute battery packs, food, and information
* Cost: 1 million from the acute reserve
* Result: No looting, no riots, higher trust in the municipality

**Year 5:**

* The Fund: 10 million (of which 1 million was spent in the Ivar crisis)
* New Policy: Part of the fund is invested in solar panels and battery storage to reduce future vulnerability
* Economic Gain: The municipality saves 500,000 SEK/year in energy costs

## Integration with Hearts and Leaves

For municipalities that want to go further, the Resilience Fund can be used to introduce alternative currencies:

**Hearts:** Non-tradeable points that youths receive for contributing to society (care of the elderly, cleaning of parks, etc.). Can be exchanged for municipal services, discounts on public transport, access to sports facilities.

**Leaves:** Points for ecological work (planting trees, recycling, etc.). Can be exchanged for similar benefits.

This system:

1. Creates parallel economic incentives outside the black economy
2. Gives recognition for constructive actions
3. Builds local currency that cannot be stolen or abused

**But this is optional.** The Resilience Fund works even without it.

## Next Steps

Once you have decided to allocate 0.1%:

1. Change procurement routines (technically simple)
2. Establish the Coordination Council (see Crisis Management Protocols)
3. Start financing Community Teams (see next chapter)
