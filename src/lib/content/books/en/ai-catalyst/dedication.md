**Dedication**

*To my mother,*

*who understood what I would only later learn to name: that five human systems could become something greater than the sum of their parts. In raising us, you never tried to make us the same—instead, you taught us the art of asking "What is their opinion?" before proposing our own ideas.*

*You showed me that true leadership isn't about having the right answer, but about creating conditions where each person can contribute from their unique gifts while the whole family flourished. You orchestrated our household not through dominance or consensus, but through what I now recognize as Yellow consciousness: meeting each of us where we were while weaving us into a coherent, loving system.*

*The seeds of systems thinking you planted in our childhood have grown into this book. Every page reflects the wisdom you embodied: that different perspectives aren't obstacles to overcome, but resources to integrate. That harmony doesn't require uniformity. That the art of asking good questions matters more than defending fixed positions.*

*Thank you for being my first teacher in the consciousness this world so desperately needs.*
