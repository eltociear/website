## **Research Methodology Notes**

**AI Dialogue Research**: This book incorporates insights from extensive conversations with multiple AI systems (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok) to understand their native cognitive capacities and systems-thinking abilities. These conversations are referenced throughout as primary source material for understanding AI's potential as a cognitive catalyst.

**Developmental Psychology Integration**: The book synthesizes research from multiple schools of adult development theory, including Spiral Dynamics, Kegan's constructive-developmental theory, and integral philosophy, while acknowledging their Western cultural origins and limitations.

**Global Governance Framework Design**: The governance frameworks referenced throughout represent years of collaborative design work incorporating insights from Indigenous governance systems, complexity science, and anticipatory governance research.
