## **About the Author**

**Björn Kenneth Holmström** is a systems thinker, writer, and political innovator from Sweden whose work explores how human consciousness and governance can evolve in partnership with artificial intelligence.

From a childhood fascination with globes, languages, and cultural diversity, Björn’s path led him to study Engineering Physics and later to immerse himself in questions of meaning, philosophy, and collective evolution. His journey through Spiral Dynamics, integral theory, and consciousness practices inspired him to found [**Spiralize.org**](https://www.spiralize.org), a platform for understanding developmental stages, and [**Fjärilspartiet (the Butterfly Party)**](https://www.fjarilspartiet.se), an experimental political initiative in Sweden grounded in systems thinking and regenerative values.

He is the creator of the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)** project, a comprehensive set of living blueprints for addressing the polycrisis through integrative governance, adaptive economics, and cultural pluralism. His projects also include tools like [**TiTo**](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/tito/), a personal time tracker, and a wide constellation of “–ize” platforms exploring themes of human growth, spirituality, and planetary stewardship.

Björn’s work is characterized by a rare blending of **technical skill, philosophical depth, and imaginative vision**. He collaborates with leading AI systems to co-create frameworks, books, and tools, treating artificial intelligence not only as a coding assistant but as a dialogical partner for expanding human cognition.

He writes with the conviction that the defining challenge of our time is not only technological, ecological, or political, but **a crisis of consciousness** — and that by cultivating new forms of wisdom, empathy, and integrative thinking, humanity can make AI a catalyst for flourishing rather than fragmentation.

When not building frameworks or writing, Björn continues to explore contemplative practice, sacred geometry, and the intersections of science and mysticism.
