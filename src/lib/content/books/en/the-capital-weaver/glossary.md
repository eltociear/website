# Glossary

## A

**AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income)**: A three-layer economic security framework that provides universal baseline income while strengthening local economic networks through Hearts currency integration and targeted equity provisions. Unlike traditional UBI, AUBI is designed to enhance community sovereignty rather than create dependency. *(Chapter 3)*

**Assurance Protocol**: A four-step verification system (enterprise self-reporting, community review circles, third-party audits, ongoing monitoring) designed to distinguish authentic regenerative transformation from sophisticated impact theater. *(Chapter 9)*

**Aurora Accord**: Transparency and accountability standards within the GGF that ensure public reporting on regenerative metrics and community feedback, creating accountability mechanisms that enterprises cannot control or manipulate. *(Chapter 8)*

## B

**BAZ (Bioregional Autonomous Zone)**: Governance territories organized around natural boundaries (watersheds, ecosystems, cultural territories) where communities exercise collective sovereignty over social, economic, and ecological systems. BAZs enable community-controlled development at bioregional scale. *(Chapters 1, 3)*

**BAZ Starter Pack**: Philanthropic funding package ($2M-$5M) that supports Indigenous communities and place-based communities in establishing legal infrastructure, governance capacity, and economic transition for bioregional autonomy. *(Chapter 8)*

## C

**Capital Stack**: The combination of different financial instruments (grants, loans, equity) used to fund an enterprise. Regenerative capital stacks prioritize community sovereignty and mission alignment over traditional investor control. *(Chapter 7)*

**Capital Weaver**: An investor who uses capital allocation to strengthen rather than extract from the social and ecological fabric, implementing the five principles of regenerative investing through relationship-based rather than transaction-based approaches. *(Introduction)*

**Community Review Circle**: Democratic assessment process using sortition (random selection) to enable affected communities to evaluate enterprise impact using community-defined criteria rather than external metrics. Core component of the Assurance Protocol. *(Chapter 9)*

**Community Sovereignty**: The principle that communities have inherent right to govern themselves, control their resources, and determine their own development priorities. Goes beyond stakeholder consultation to genuine partnership and shared governance authority. *(Chapter 1)*

## F

**FPIC 2.0 (Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0)**: Enhanced framework for community consent that ensures ongoing relationship and shared power throughout investment partnerships, not just one-time approval of predetermined projects. *(Chapter 5)*

## G

**GGF (Global Governance Framework)**: Comprehensive system of interconnected frameworks designed to enable regenerative economic development at scale, including BAZs, AUBI, Hearthstone Protocol, and Treaty for Our Only Home. *(Chapter 13)*

**Golden Share**: Special governance share that gives communities veto power over major enterprise decisions regardless of their financial stake, preventing mission drift and hostile takeovers. *(Chapters 2, 7)*

**Green Extractivism**: Development projects that address environmental concerns while undermining community sovereignty and social foundations of well-being. Often characterized by external control despite environmental benefits. *(Chapters 1, 3)*

## H

**Hearts Currency**: Regenerative currency that rewards care work, community relationship-building, cultural preservation, and other activities that strengthen social fabric but are typically uncompensated in market economies. Circulates locally to strengthen community resilience. *(Chapters 3, 10)*

**Hearthstone Protocol**: Legal framework for transitioning assets from private ownership to community stewardship through trust structures that preserve mission alignment across generations while enabling patient capital participation. *(Chapters 2, 8)*

## I

**Impact Theater**: Sophisticated measurement and reporting that demonstrates impressive social and environmental metrics while maintaining fundamentally extractive relationships with communities and ecosystems. Distinguished from authentic transformation through community-controlled verification. *(Chapter 9)*

**IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**: Traditional financial metric that calculates the annual rate of return an investment generates over its lifetime. Commonly used benchmark in conventional investing, but captures only financial value while ignoring social and ecological impacts. *(Chapter 4)*

## L

**Leaves Currency**: Regenerative currency that rewards ecological restoration, climate adaptation, biodiversity preservation, and other activities that enhance ecosystem health. Can be exchanged for carbon credits and ecosystem service payments. *(Chapters 3, 10)*

**LMCI (Love, Meaning, and Connection Index)**: Measurement framework that captures social and cultural foundations of authentic prosperity by tracking relationship health, purpose alignment, and ecological connection within communities. *(Introduction, Chapters 1-5)*

**LMCI-T Feedback Loop**: Integration of truth-seeking verification ("T") with Love, Meaning, and Connection measurement, ensuring that high LMCI scores reflect genuine flourishing rather than impression management. *(Introduction)*

**Love Ledger**: Non-monetized system for recognizing and connecting informal acts of care and mutual support, making visible the web of relationships that sustain community well-being. *(Chapter 3)*

## N

**Nested Economies Framework**: Three-level approach to economic integration (local Hearts economies, regional BAZ coordination, global cooperation) that preserves community autonomy while enabling broader connection and resource sharing. *(Chapter 3)*

## P

**Patient Capital**: Investment approach that accepts longer time horizons (7-20+ years) and modest financial returns in exchange for authentic community impact and mission alignment. Structured to support rather than control community-controlled enterprises. *(Chapters 2, 8)*

**Polycentric Resilience**: Economic strategy that creates strength through diversity and distributed prosperity rather than concentrated wealth. Builds multiple interconnected sources of prosperity that can support each other during stress. *(Chapter 3)*

## R

**Regenerative Capital Scorecard**: Five-category assessment tool (Ethical & Social Foundation, Economic Justice, Ecological Regeneration, Leadership & Governance, RoR Integration) for evaluating investment opportunities using regenerative principles rather than conventional ESG metrics. *(Chapter 6)*

**Regenerative Moat**: Competitive advantages created through stakeholder relationships, ecological stewardship, and community trust that cannot be replicated through cost-cutting or efficiency optimization. *(Chapter 6)*

**Right Relationship**: Investment principle requiring that all economic relationships be grounded in truth, reciprocity, and genuine care for flourishing of all parties. Goes beyond consent to ensure relationships strengthen rather than extract from the web of life. *(Chapter 5)*

**RoR (Return on Regeneration)**: Measurement framework that integrates financial, social, and ecological value creation as complementary rather than competing objectives. Reveals how authentic impact often enhances rather than compromises risk-adjusted financial returns. *(Chapter 4)*

## S

**Stewardship Over Ownership**: Investment principle that prioritizes long-term care for people and planet over short-term extraction for profit. Uses legal structures that preserve mission alignment while enabling patient capital participation. *(Chapter 2)*

**Stewardship Trust**: Legal structure that places enterprises under permanent mission-dedicated governance, preventing sale to entities that don't share regenerative commitments while enabling sustainable operations and community control. *(Chapter 2)*

## T

**Truth Advocate**: Formal role within enterprise governance specifically tasked with challenging comfortable assumptions, ensuring problems reach decision-makers, and rewarding delivery of bad news. Essential for preventing mission drift and maintaining authentic community relationships. *(Chapters 6, 9)*

**Truth-Seeking Practice**: Systematic approach to seeking uncomfortable realities that enable authentic progress. Core discipline underlying all regenerative investing principles, distinguishing genuine transformation from wishful thinking or manipulation. *(Throughout)*

## V

**Venture Commons**: Digital platform for regenerative deal flow, community-controlled verification, and knowledge sharing between Capital Weavers. Provides pre-screened opportunities and standards-compliant data rooms for regenerative investors. *(Chapters 11, 14)*
