# Appendix E: The GGF Standards Crosswalk

*Mapping regenerative investment frameworks to established reporting standards and regulations*

## Introduction: Bridging Emerging and Established Standards

Capital Weavers operate in a dual reality: the emerging regenerative economy with its own metrics and currencies, and the established financial system with its regulatory requirements and reporting standards. This crosswalk provides practical guidance for meeting both sets of requirements efficiently.

Rather than viewing regulatory compliance as separate from regenerative practice, this appendix demonstrates how regenerative frameworks often exceed conventional requirements while providing superior risk management and stakeholder value creation.
