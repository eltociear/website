# Appendix G: Finding Regenerative Deals

*Comprehensive guide to sourcing, evaluating, and accessing regenerative investment opportunities*

## Introduction: From Scarcity to Abundance

One of the most common concerns among investors interested in regenerative approaches is: "Where do I find these opportunities?" This appendix transforms that challenge into strategic advantage by mapping the growing ecosystem of regenerative deal flow, providing specific platforms and processes for accessing opportunities, and showing how to cultivate your own pipeline of regenerative investments.

The reality is that regenerative opportunities exist across all sectors and geographies—they're often hidden within conventional deal flow or emerging from communities and enterprises that don't yet speak the language of finance. This guide helps you develop the vision to recognize regenerative potential and the networks to access authentic opportunities.

**Key Success Factors**:

**1. Relationship First**: Prioritize community relationships over immediate deal flow
**2. Sector Expertise**: Develop deep knowledge in specific regenerative sectors and practices
**3. Patient Capital**: Offer investment terms aligned with regenerative development timelines
**4. Cultural Sensitivity**: Approach all opportunities with humility and respect for local cultural values
**5. Impact Verification**: Use rigorous verification processes to ensure authentic regenerative impact

**Strategic Approaches**:

**Community Partnership Model**: Build long-term relationships with 3-5 communities or bioregions, offering patient capital and technical assistance aligned with community-defined priorities.

**Sector Specialization Model**: Develop expertise in 2-3 regenerative sectors, building networks with practitioners, researchers, and enterprises leading regenerative innovation.

**Platform Integration Model**: Participate actively in Venture Commons and other regenerative investment platforms while contributing to platform development and community building.

**Infrastructure Development Model**: Invest in the development of regenerative economy infrastructure—CDFIs, cooperative development organizations, Hearts/Leaves currency systems—that generates ongoing deal flow.
