## About This Book

This comprehensive guide transforms how investors, philanthropists, and fund managers approach capital allocation by moving beyond ESG frameworks toward authentic regenerative investing. Through practical tools, real-world case studies, and systematic frameworks, learn how to create prosperity through healing rather than extraction.

The book provides everything needed to become a "Capital Weaver"—an investor who uses capital to mend rather than extract from the social and ecological fabric that sustains all life. From individual deal analysis to portfolio construction, discover how regenerative principles create competitive advantages while serving community sovereignty and ecological health.

### What You'll Discover

- **The Five Principles of Regenerative Capital**: Community Sovereignty, Stewardship Over Ownership, Polycentric Resilience, Return on Regeneration, and Right Relationship
- **Practical Assessment Tools**: The Regenerative Capital Scorecard for evaluating opportunities and the Return on Regeneration calculator for measuring integrated value creation
- **Financial Structures That Work**: Capital stack designs, patient capital approaches, and governance innovations that preserve mission alignment while generating sustainable returns
- **Role-Specific Guidance**: Tailored strategies for philanthropists, impact investors, community funds, and family offices
- **Community-Controlled Verification**: Four-step assurance protocols that distinguish authentic transformation from sophisticated impact theater
- **Portfolio Design for Resilience**: How to build strength through interconnection rather than protection through isolation

### Who This Book Serves

**Philanthropists** seeking to fund systemic change with lasting impact beyond traditional charity approaches

**Impact Investors** balancing profit and regeneration while supporting community-controlled enterprises

**Community Funds** building resilient local economies that circulate rather than extract wealth

**Family Offices** crafting multi-generational legacy strategies that steward rather than deplete the commons

**Anyone with Capital** who recognizes that money is not neutral—every investment either strengthens or weakens the relationships that sustain all prosperity

## About the Method

This book emerged from an innovative collaboration between human vision and artificial intelligence. The frameworks, principles, and narrative were developed through dialogues with Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), DeepSeek, and Grok (xAI), with each AI contributing unique perspectives while the author provided direction, synthesis, and final judgment on all content.
