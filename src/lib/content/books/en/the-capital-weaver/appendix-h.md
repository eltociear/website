## Quick Win #8: Use the RoR Calculator for One Deal

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours initial setup  
**Implementation**: Apply Return on Regeneration methodology to current or prospective investment

### Understanding Return on Regeneration (RoR)

RoR integrates financial, social, and ecological returns into a comprehensive metric showing total value creation from regenerative investments. Unlike traditional ROI, RoR captures value that conventional analysis misses while demonstrating superior risk-adjusted returns.

### Basic RoR Calculation Process

**Step 1: Calculate Financial Returns** (Traditional component)
- Operating income/EBITDA improvements
- Asset value appreciation including regenerative premiums
- Cost savings from circular operations and stakeholder loyalty
- Revenue growth from mission-driven customer base
- Risk mitigation value from community support and ecological resilience

**Step 2: Quantify Social Value Creation** (LMCI integration)
- Employment value: jobs created at living wages × premium over market rates
- Community health improvements: healthcare cost savings × affected population
- Skills development: training provided × market value of skills gained
- Social cohesion: community event participation × social value per person
- Democratic participation: increased civic engagement × democratic value per person

**Step 3: Assess Ecological Value Created** (Planetary health integration)
- Carbon sequestration: tonnes CO2e × social cost of carbon ($185/tonne)
- Biodiversity enhancement: habitat restoration × ecosystem service value ($1,000-5,000/acre)
- Water services: filtration and conservation × local water cost savings
- Soil health: improvement in soil organic matter × agricultural productivity value
- Pollution reduction: emissions avoided × environmental health cost savings

**Step 4: Account for Transition Costs**
- Additional due diligence and structuring costs for regenerative approaches
- Premium costs for stakeholder engagement and community partnerships
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting costs for impact measurement
- Legal costs for mission protection and stakeholder governance structures
