# Preface

This book began with a question that haunts our time: How can we create prosperity without destroying the foundations that make prosperity possible?

We see brilliant, well-intentioned people deploy capital toward solutions that address symptoms while intensifying underlying causes. We fund clean energy projects that displace communities. We support sustainable agriculture that consolidates land ownership. We invest in mental health solutions while participating in economic systems that generate anxiety and isolation.

The Capital Weaver framework emerged from recognition that our crisis is not technical but relational. We don't lack solutions—we lack economic relationships that support the implementation of solutions we already know. This book offers practical tools for investors ready to become weavers rather than extractors, healers rather than harmers of the social and ecological fabric that sustains all life.

The regenerative economy is not a distant possibility but an emerging reality. Communities worldwide are proving that another way is not only possible but profitable, resilient, and deeply fulfilling. The question is whether existing capital will support this emergence or be left behind by it.
