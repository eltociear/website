# Appendix J: Global South Case Studies
*Regenerative investing in action across diverse cultural and economic contexts*

## Introduction: Centering Global South Innovation

This appendix showcases regenerative investing as it manifests in the Global South, where traditional knowledge systems, community ownership models, and ecological restoration practices often provide more mature templates for regenerative economics than those found in industrialized nations.

Rather than viewing the Global South as a recipient of development interventions, these case studies demonstrate how Indigenous wisdom, community-led governance, and local innovation are leading the transition to regenerative economies. Many of the principles now being "discovered" by progressive investors in the North have been practiced for millennia in the Global South.

**Key Themes Across Global South Regenerative Investing:**
- Community ownership and democratic governance as foundational rather than aspirational
- Traditional ecological knowledge informing modern restoration techniques
- Circular economy practices embedded in cultural traditions
- Resilience strategies developed through centuries of resource scarcity
- Women's leadership in community economics and ecological stewardship

**Methodology**: These case studies emerged through partnerships with Community Weavers and local organizations, ensuring authentic representation of community voices and outcomes. All financial data has been verified through community assemblies and independent audits.
