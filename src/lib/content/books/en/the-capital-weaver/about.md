# About the method
This book emerged from an innovative collaboration between human vision and artificial intelligence. The frameworks, principles, and narrative were developed through dialogues with Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), DeepSeek, and Grok (xAI), with each AI contributing unique perspectives while the author provided direction, synthesis, and final judgment on all content.
