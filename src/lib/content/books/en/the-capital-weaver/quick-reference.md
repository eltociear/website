**Suggested Reader Tracks:**
* **The Explorer Track:** New to regenerative finance? Follow Sarah's narrative and focus on the principles in Part I, then explore the tools that resonate most with your current practice.
* **The Practitioner Track:** Ready to put capital to work? Start with Chapter 6 (The Regenerative Capital Scorecard), then dive deep into the Toolkit in Part II and use the Appendices extensively.
* **The Architect Track:** Interested in building a new economy? Read the whole book, paying close attention to how individual tools connect to the systemic frameworks in Part III.

**Key Integration Points:**
The book demonstrates how practical investment tools (Part II) contribute to larger systemic transformation (Part III) without requiring you to adopt the entire GGF framework. Each regenerative investment strengthens the conditions that make broader economic transformation possible.
