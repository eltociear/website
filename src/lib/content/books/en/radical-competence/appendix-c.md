# Appendix C: Municipal Resolution Templates

*Copy-Paste Ready Legal Language for Local Implementation*

---

## How to Use These Templates

These are **working documents**, not aspirational manifestos. Each template has been designed for actual municipal adoption, with:

- **Legal language** that works with existing UK/EU local government structures
- **Minimal dependencies** (can implement without national approval)
- **Phased rollout** options (start small, prove concept, expand)
- **Budget flexibility** (works at £10K or £10M scale)
- **Clear metrics** so you know if it's working

**Your job**: Fill in the bracketed sections, present to your council, get it passed. Start small if needed—even a single sanctuary designation or pilot program creates precedent.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

3. **Month 12-18**: Community feedback, adjust policies
4. **Month 18-24**: Expand to second area if successful

**Common Objections & Responses**:
- **"This limits business freedom"**: Voluntary opt-in for businesses; no one forced to locate in Sanctuary District

---

### ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

[250 words maximum - drafted by measure proponents]

Sample argument:
"Our community faces growing economic insecurity. Hard-working residents struggle with rising costs, precarious employment, and inadequate support systems. This measure offers a tested solution.

Adaptive Universal Basic Income provides direct cash payments—no bureaucracy, no paternalism, just resources for people to meet their needs and pursue their potential. Evidence from [pilot cities] shows reduced poverty, improved health, and strengthened communities.

This isn't traditional welfare. AUBI:
- Goes to everyone, reducing stigma
- Rewards care work and community service
- Adapts to individual circumstances
- Strengthens, doesn't replace, existing supports
- Includes rigorous evaluation and sunset clause

Costs are covered through fair taxes on [revenue sources] with no new debt. The pilot structure lets us test the approach and decide based on results.

Economic security isn't a luxury—it's a foundation for thriving communities. Vote YES to give our residents a chance at stability and our community a chance to lead."

Signed:
[Proponent names and titles]

---

### ARGUMENT AGAINST

[250 words maximum - drafted by measure opponents]

Sample argument:
"This costly experiment puts our municipal finances at risk. While goals are admirable, implementation raises serious concerns.

The £[XXX]M annual cost requires substantial new taxes affecting all residents and businesses. Economic projections are optimistic and may not materialize, leaving the program underfunded or requiring cuts to essential services.

Key concerns:
- Fiscal sustainability uncertain
- May discourage work and economic activity
- Administrative complexity and potential fraud
- Unfair to those who don't benefit
- Better approaches exist (job training, targeted support)

Evidence from other jurisdictions is mixed. Some programs succeeded, others failed. Why should our community serve as testing ground?

We should address poverty through proven methods: job creation, skills training, affordable housing, and targeted support for those most in need. Universal payments waste resources on those who don't need them.

The sunset clause provides little protection—political pressure to continue a popular program may override fiscal reality.

We support helping struggling residents, but this expensive, untested approach isn't the answer. Vote NO and demand better solutions."

Signed:
[Opponent names and titles]

---

### REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST

[125 words maximum]

Sample rebuttal:
"Opponents offer no alternative solutions—just objections. Our current approach isn't working: poverty persists, economic insecurity grows, community bonds weaken.

The 'targeted support' they advocate creates stigma, bureaucracy, and gaps. AUBI is efficient: money goes directly to residents, not administrators.

Fiscal concerns are addressed: balanced budget requirement, reserves, and sunset clause ensure sustainability. We're not asking for blind faith—the pilot structure provides evaluation and accountability.

The real question: Can we afford NOT to try? The cost of poverty—in health, crime, lost potential—far exceeds program costs.

This is responsible innovation, not reckless experimentation. Vote YES."

---

### REBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR

[125 words maximum]

Sample rebuttal:
"Proponents' optimism ignores hard realities. 'Evidence' they cite comes from small, limited pilots that may not scale.

The claim that costs are 'covered' relies on untested assumptions. When projections fall short, will we raise taxes further or cut the program?

'Everyone benefits' sounds fair until you realize struggling families pay the same taxes but receive no more than the wealthy. That's not justice—it's waste.

We're not against helping those in need. We're against an expensive, inefficient approach that benefits everyone equally regardless of need.

Real solutions target resources where they're needed most. Vote NO for responsible social policy."

# Conclusion to Appendix C

These four templates provide the legal infrastructure to begin implementing Yellow-level systems at the municipal scale.

**They're designed to be:**
- **Actually passable** (not aspirational wishlists)
- **Mutually reinforcing** (each strengthens the others)
- **Scalable** (start small, prove concept, expand)
- **Replicable** (what works in Reading can work in Bristol, Manchester, Glasgow...)

**Use them strategically:**
1. Start with what your local context makes easiest
2. Build evidence and community support
3. Use success to justify the next step
4. Connect activists in different cities doing the same work

**Remember:** The oligarchy wins when we think we need permission. These templates show you already have the legal authority to start building alternatives.

The question isn't "Can we?" It's "Who goes first?"

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose which template fits your context
2. Customize for local circumstances
3. Build your coalition
4. Present to Council or gather signatures
5. Document and share your experience

We're building a network of rebel municipalities. Every successful implementation makes the next one easier.

Let's go.
