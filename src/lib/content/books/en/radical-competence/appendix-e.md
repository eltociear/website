# Appendix E: Further Reading That Doesn't Waste Your Time

**Most reading lists are for contemplation. This one is for ammunition.**

This is not a bibliography. It is a curated list of the manuals, blueprints, and case studies that provide the highest return on attention for an Architect.

If a book is listed here, it’s because it contains a tool you can use on Monday morning.

### 1. The Operating System (How to Think)

* **Thinking in Systems: A Primer** – *Donella Meadows*
    * **Why:** The bible of Yellow thinking. It teaches you to see stocks, flows, and feedback loops. Read Chapter 6 ("Leverage Points") first. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book.
* **Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership and Change** – *Beck & Cowan*
    * **Why:** The source code for the "Color Code" used in this book. If you want to understand *why* people resist change, this is the manual.
* **The Dawn of Everything** – *Graeber & Wengrow*
    * **Why:** Shatters the myth that "hierarchy is inevitable." It proves that human societies have consciously chosen and discarded social systems for 30,000 years. It gives you permission to design something new.

### 2. The Economic Engine (How to Fund)

* **Doughnut Economics** – *Kate Raworth*
    * **Why:** It moves economics from "Growth" (Orange) to "Balance" (Yellow). It provides the visual dashboard for the 21st-century city.
* **The Case for a Job Guarantee** – *Pavolina Tcherneva*
    * **Why:** The tactical companion to AUBI. It explains how to structuralize the "Floor" using existing state mechanisms.
* **Sacred Economics** – *Charles Eisenstein*
    * **Why:** The philosophical grounding for the "Love Ledger" and gift economics. Read it to deprogram your scarcity mindset.

### 3. The Field Manuals (How to Organize)

* **Rules for Radicals** – *Saul Alinsky*
    * **Why:** The classic manual on "Power" vs. "Purity." It teaches you to start where the world *is*, not where you want it to be. (Read with a grain of salt, but learn the tactics).
* **Emergent Strategy** – *adrienne maree brown*
    * **Why:** The "Green/Yellow" update to organizing. It teaches you how to build movements that function like fractals and ecosystems, not armies.
* **Blueprint for Revolution** – *Srdja Popovic*
    * **Why:** Written by the serbian organizers who toppled Milošević. It teaches "Laughtivism" and low-risk, high-impact tactics. Essential for the "Pushback" phase.

### 4. Case Studies (Proof it Works)

* **The Preston Model** (Report by CLES)
    * **What:** How a struggling UK city kept £700 million local by changing procurement rules.
    * **Use for:** Convincing councillors that "Community Wealth Building" is safer than "Inward Investment."
* **The Mondragon Cooperative Corporation** (Case Studies)
    * **What:** A Basque federation of worker cooperatives with 80,000+ employees.
    * **Use for:** Proving that democratic ownership scales.
* **The G20 Inequality Report 2025** – *Stiglitz et al.*
    * **What:** The mainstream validation of the GGF thesis.
    * **Use for:** Hitting "Blue/Orange" gatekeepers with Nobel Prize-winning authority.

### 5. Digital Tools (The Stack)

* **Kumu.io** – For mapping power and systems.
* **Loomio** – For making democratic decisions without endless meetings.
* **Obsidian** – For building your own "Second Brain" / Knowledge Commons.

**Final Instruction:**
Don't just read these. **Use them.**
A map is useless if you never leave the house.

**The library is open. Go build.**
