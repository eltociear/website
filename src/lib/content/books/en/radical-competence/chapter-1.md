# Chapter 1: The Metadata - How the Scripts Actually Run

You already know the game is rigged.

You don't need me to tell you that housing costs are insane, that wages haven't kept pace with productivity for decades, that the "rich bastards" keep getting richer while everyone else scrambles. You've seen the charts. You've made the YouTube shorts. You know.

What you might not know is *exactly how the script works*.

See, most people think the rigging happens through obvious corruption - backroom deals, lobbying, regulatory capture. And sure, that happens. But that's the **visible UI** - the exploits that occasionally make the news and get patched (or at least get public outrage).

The real scripts - the ones that matter - are running in plain sight. They're *legal*. They're *documented*. Most activists walk right past them because they don't look like exploits. They look like "how things work."

Let me show you three.

## Script #1: The Housing Accumulator

Here's what everyone knows: housing is unaffordable. Prices have decoupled from wages. Young people can't buy homes.

Here's what fewer people track: *why* this isn't a temporary market fluctuation but a structural feature.

**The mechanism:**

1. **Central banks lower interest rates** (to "stimulate the economy")
2. **Cheap credit flows into asset markets** (including real estate)
3. **Asset prices inflate** (housing costs rise)
4. **Existing homeowners gain wealth** (through appreciation)
5. **New buyers need bigger mortgages** (to afford inflated prices)
6. **Banks profit from larger loans** (more interest over time)
7. **Rinse and repeat**

Now here's the key part most people miss: **This isn't a bug. It's load-bearing architecture.**

When the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve talks about "using monetary policy to support the economy," what they actually mean is: "We're going to make credit cheaper so that asset prices go up, because we've built an economic system that requires perpetual asset inflation to function."

Why? Because:

- **Pension funds** depend on real estate investment trusts (REITs) for returns
- **Bank balance sheets** use housing as collateral for loans
- **Consumer spending** is sustained by people feeling wealthy (the "wealth effect" from rising home values)
- **Political stability** requires the homeowning middle class to feel secure

So housing *must* keep appreciating, or the entire system wobbles.

But here's the exploit: **You can't have housing as both a human right (affordable shelter) AND an investment vehicle (appreciating asset).**

If housing becomes affordable, asset prices crash. If asset prices must keep rising, housing becomes unaffordable.

The script chose the latter. And it's not an accident - it's a feature that serves the people who already own assets.

**The scripter's advantage:** They bought in early, when prices were lower. Now they own appreciating assets *and* can use them as collateral to buy more appreciating assets. Meanwhile, you're trying to save for a deposit while rent takes 40% of your income - and every year you save, prices rise faster than your savings.

You're not playing the same game. You're playing a game where the win condition for you (affordable housing) is incompatible with the system's win condition (asset appreciation).

## Script #2: The Wage Suppression Loop

Everyone knows wages haven't kept pace with productivity. You've seen the chart - productivity goes up and up, wages stay flat.

But do you know *how* that divergence is maintained?

**The mechanism:**

1. **Companies automate** or offshore jobs (increasing productivity per worker)
2. **Labor supply increases** (more people competing for fewer jobs)
3. **Bargaining power shifts** to employers (because labor is abundant)
4. **Wages stay flat** or decline (despite higher output per worker)
5. **Profits increase** (productivity gains go to shareholders, not workers)
6. **Shareholders reinvest** in more automation/offshoring
7. **Loop continues**

But here's where it gets interesting: this script has a *legal support system* that makes it harder to patch than people realize.

**Legal script components:**

- **Labor law erosion:** Union protections weakened over decades
- **Gig economy classification:** Workers reclassified as "contractors" (no benefits, no collective bargaining)
- **Non-compete agreements:** Even low-wage workers bound by terms limiting job mobility
- **Wage theft normalized:** Unpaid overtime, misclassification, tip theft - under-enforced by regulators
- **Tax policy:** Capital gains taxed lower than labor income (rewarding ownership over work)

Each of these is *legal*. Each passed through democratic processes. Each is documented policy.

And together, they create a system where:

**Working harder ≠ earning more**

In fact, the system actively punishes labor while rewarding capital. The "scripters" in this game aren't breaking rules - they're exploiting rules that were written to favor them.

**The scripter's advantage:** If you own assets (stocks, real estate, businesses), your wealth grows automatically through appreciation and returns. If you only have labor to sell, you're in a market deliberately oversupplied, under-protected, and structurally disadvantaged.

You can work 60 hours a week and still fall behind someone who inherited a stock portfolio and works zero hours.

## Script #3: The Debt Dependency Engine

This one's subtle, and it's the script that keeps the other two running.

You probably know that household debt has exploded. What you might not track is that this isn't failure - it's *required function*.

**The mechanism:**

Modern economies run on debt. Not just government debt (though that too), but *consumer debt*. Credit cards, student loans, mortgages, car loans, payday loans.

Why? Because if everyone only spent what they earned in wages, and wages are suppressed (Script #2), then consumer spending collapses, and consumer spending is 60-70% of GDP in most developed economies.

So the system needs people to spend money they don't have.

**The debt trap architecture:**

1. **Wages insufficient for cost of living** (Script #2 + Script #1)
2. **Essential goods locked behind debt** (education, housing, transportation)
3. **Credit offered as solution** ("You can afford it with financing!")
4. **Interest extracts wealth** (from debtor to creditor, perpetually)
5. **Debt becomes inescapable** (especially student loans - can't discharge in bankruptcy)
6. **Debtors become compliant workers** (can't risk job loss with debt payments due)

This is the control mechanism. It's not just that people are poor - it's that they're *structurally indebted*, which means:

- **Less bargaining power** (can't strike, can't quit, can't take risks)
- **Less political power** (time and energy consumed by survival)
- **Permanent wealth transfer** (interest payments flowing upward)

**The scripter's advantage:** If you're on the creditor side of this equation (you own the bank, the bonds, the loan portfolios), you have a permanent claim on other people's future labor. The system is designed to keep people *perpetually* in debt, not to help them escape it.

Student loan "forgiveness" debates are a perfect example: the system oscillates between "personal responsibility" (you borrowed it, pay it back) and "investment in human capital" (society benefits from education), but never questions why education requires debt in the first place.

Because if it didn't require debt, the financial sector would lose a massive profit stream.

## The Pattern You're Seeing

Three scripts. Three different domains (housing, labor, finance). But notice what they have in common:

1. **They're legal** (not corruption, but design)
2. **They're interconnected** (each reinforces the others)
3. **They transfer wealth upward** (from labor to capital, from young to old, from poor to rich)
4. **They're presented as natural** ("market forces," "economic reality")
5. **Attempts to fix one fail** (because the other two compensate)

This is what I mean when I say the oligarchy isn't winning because they're smarter. They're winning because **they designed the game board**.

**Quick detection heuristic:** If something in the economy is legal, interconnected with other systems, transfers wealth upward, gets defended as "just how things work," and resists single-issue fixes—you're looking at a script, not a bug. Once you see the pattern, you'll spot them everywhere.

You've seen this pattern in games. An exploit that's not technically cheating, just bad design. The devs won't patch it because it's load-bearing—other systems depend on it. So what do you do? You don't keep filing bug reports. You build a mod, or a private server, where that exploit doesn't work.

Same principle here. Except the stakes are housing and healthcare instead of leaderboard positions.

And here's the thing that should make you both angry and strategic:

**Most activists don't even see these scripts running.**

They see *symptoms*: "Housing is too expensive!" "Wages are too low!" "Everyone's in debt!"

So they propose *symptom-level fixes*: "Build more housing!" "Raise minimum wage!" "Forgive student loans!"

And those fixes either:
- Get blocked by the people running the scripts
- Get implemented in watered-down form that doesn't threaten the scripts
- Work temporarily until the scripts adapt and compensate

Because you can't fix a systemic exploit with a local patch.

## What This Means For Strategy

If you came to this book hoping I'd give you better tactics for the fight you're already in - better arguments, better organizing methods, better policy proposals - I'm going to disappoint you.

Because the fight you're in is the wrong fight.

**You've been playing whack-a-mole with symptoms. The moles are infinite. Time to unplug the machine.**

It's not that protest doesn't matter. It's not that policy advocacy is useless. It's not that organizing is a waste of time.

It's that all of those are *player-level tactics* in a game where the rules themselves are the problem.

The oligarchy doesn't fear your protest. They fear you understanding their source code.

They don't fear your voting. They fear you building alternative infrastructure that makes their scripts obsolete.

They don't fear your anger. They fear your *competence*.

Because here's what you probably already intuited but maybe haven't fully articulated:

**The people running these scripts aren't actually that good at much beyond extracting wealth from existing systems.**

They're not brilliant designers. They're not visionary architects. They're not even particularly creative.

They're just *in position* at the chokepoints of systems that were designed (often decades or centuries ago) to concentrate wealth and power.

Take away those chokepoints - build different systems with different rules - and their advantages evaporate.

But you can't do that by playing their game better. You have to build a different game entirely.

And that requires understanding not just that the scripts exist, but *how they work*, so you can design systems where those scripts can't run.

## The Question That Matters

So here's where we are:

You can see the scripts now. You understand they're not bugs - they're architecture.

The question is: **What game can you build where these scripts don't compile?**

Not "How do we regulate them better?" (they'll capture the regulators)
Not "How do we tax them more?" (they'll offshore or lobby)
Not "How do we shame them into decency?" (they're not ashamed)

But: **What parallel system can we build that makes their system irrelevant?**

That's what the rest of this book is about.

Not how to win the rigged game.
How to stop playing it.

**Next:** If this chapter already felt obvious to you—if you're thinking "yeah, I see the scripts, tell me something new"—then good. Skip ahead to Chapter 2.

Because Part I continues with mapping the other major scripts (the attention extraction engine, the political capture mechanism, the ecological debt accumulation). But if you already see the pattern, you don't need more examples.

What you need is Chapter 2: why knowing the scripts isn't enough—and why the Movement keeps bringing passion to a logistics fight.

The Movement has been shouting at these scripts for decades. The scripts are still running.

**Time to learn to code.**
