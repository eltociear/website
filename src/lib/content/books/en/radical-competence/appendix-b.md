# Appendix B: Discord/Server Community Organizing Starter Pack

*From Gaming Guilds to Mutual Aid Networks: A Field Guide*

---

You already know how to run a Discord community. You've moderated channels, organized raid nights, dealt with drama, built culture through memes and in-jokes. You know the difference between a server that thrives and one that dies after two weeks.

**This appendix is about applying that exact skillset to mutual aid, local organizing, and building the Yellow infrastructure your area needs.**

Because here's what most traditional organizers don't get: **Discord communities are the closest thing modern life has to the union halls, church basements, and coffee houses where previous generations built movements.**

You already have the skills. You just need to see how they translate.

## Part 1: From Gaming Guild to Mutual Aid Network

### The Core Insight

A healthy Discord gaming community and a healthy mutual aid network share the same infrastructure needs:

| Gaming Guild | Mutual Aid Network | The Pattern |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Clear roles (Tank/DPS/Healer) | Clear roles (Skills inventory/Needs/Coordinators) | Division of labor |
| Raid scheduling | Action coordination | Logistics |
| Voice channels for raids | Voice channels for meetings | Real-time coordination |
| Text channels by topic | Text channels by need/skill | Organized communication |
| Bot automation | Bot automation | Reducing coordinator burden |
| Onboarding for new members | Onboarding for new members | Entry ramps |
| Culture through memes | Culture through memes | Shared identity |
| Dealing with toxic players | Dealing with bad actors | Community safety |

**The structure is identical. Only the content changes.**

### What You Already Know How to Do

If you can run a 50-person gaming Discord, you can coordinate:
- Food sharing networks
- Tool libraries
- Transportation pools
- Housing support
- Skill-sharing circles
- Local political action
- Community defense

The mechanics are the same. The stakes are different.

## Part 2: Server Architecture for Mutual Aid

### Channel Structure Template

Here's a proven structure that scales from 10 to 1000+ members:

```
📌 START HERE
├─ #welcome - Automated intro message
├─ #how-this-works - Server rules and philosophy
└─ #introduce-yourself - New member intros

🤝 MUTUAL AID
├─ #requests - Things people need
├─ #offers - Things people can provide
├─ #coordination - Organizing specific aid
└─ #completed - Archive of successful mutual aid

🛠️ SKILLS & RESOURCES
├─ #skill-inventory - Who knows what
├─ #tool-library - Shared equipment
├─ #transportation - Rides and carpools
└─ #housing-support - Temporary housing/roommates

💬 COMMUNITY
├─ #general - Casual chat
├─ #local-events - What's happening nearby
├─ #victories - Celebrate wins
└─ #memes - Because morale matters

🎯 ACTION
├─ #campaigns - Ongoing organizing work
├─ #meeting-notes - Documentation
├─ #research - Information gathering
└─ #planning - Strategy discussion

🔧 META
├─ #suggestions - Server improvements
├─ #mod-chat - Private moderator channel
└─ #bot-spam - Keep automation out of main channels
```

### Roles & Permissions Strategy

**Start minimal, expand as needed:**

1. **@Everyone** (default)
   - Can see public channels
   - Can post in most channels
   - Cannot see #mod-chat or sensitive channels

2. **@Member** (verified humans)
   - Full access to community channels
   - Can create threads
   - Can use voice channels
   - *Gate this behind simple verification to prevent drive-by trolls*

3. **@Coordinator** (active organizers)
   - Can manage specific project channels
   - Can create temporary channels
   - Can pin important messages
   - *Promote based on contribution, not authority*

4. **@Moderator** (trusted community members)
   - Can manage messages/members
   - Access to mod channels
   - Can handle disputes
   - *Choose based on judgment and community trust*

5. **Skill-Based Roles** (self-assigned)
   - @Has-Car (for transportation pool)
   - @Can-Cook (for meal sharing)
   - @Good-With-Tech (for digital help)
   - @Legal-Knowledge (for know-your-rights)
   - *Let people self-identify, verify if sensitive*

### Bot Setup for Automation

**Essential bots (all free tier adequate for starting):**

**MEE6 or Carl-bot:**
- Welcome messages for new members
- Self-assignable roles
- Basic moderation (auto-mod for slurs, spam)
- Level system (if you want gamification)

**Zira or Reaction Roles:**
- Let people self-assign skill roles
- Create availability calendars
- Set up event RSVPs

**Apollo or Sesh:**
- Schedule meetings and actions
- Send reminders
- Track RSVPs and attendance

**Suggestion Box Bot:**
- Collect anonymous feedback
- Vote on server improvements
- Surface community needs

**Optional but powerful:**

**Dyno or ProBot:**
- Advanced auto-moderation
- Custom commands
- Backup/logging

**Tupperbox or PluralKit:**
- If doing committee work with multiple roles
- Useful for coordination across working groups

## Part 3: From Gaming Culture to Organizing Culture

### The Culture Translation Guide

Your gaming server had culture—inside jokes, traditions, rituals, shared history. Your organizing server needs the same, but translated:

| Gaming Server | Organizing Server | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Weekly raid night | Weekly strategy session | Regular rhythm |
| "GG" after wins | "Solidarity" after actions | Shared language |
| Loot distribution | Resource sharing protocols | Fair allocation |
| Build discussions | Tactics discussions | Strategic thinking |
| Rage-quitting → cooling off | Burnout → mutual support | Emotional sustainability |
| Guild drama | Political disagreements | Conflict is normal |
| Alt characters | Multiple roles/skills | People contain multitudes |

### Meme Culture as Movement Culture

Don't underestimate memes. Seriously.

**Memes do three things traditional organizing struggles with:**

1. **Lower barriers to entry**
   - Easier to share a meme than to write an essay
   - Humor makes hard topics approachable
   - Inside jokes create belonging

2. **Rapid cultural transmission**
   - A good meme spreads instantly
   - Carries complex ideas in simple packages
   - Creates shared reference points

3. **Emotional resilience**
   - Humor in dark times prevents burnout
   - Laughing together builds bonds
   - Mocking power reduces fear

**Create a #memes channel. Use it strategically.**

### The "No Cringe" Rule

Gaming servers die when they get cringeworthy—when admins take themselves too seriously, when everything becomes a lecture, when fun disappears.

**Same applies to organizing servers.**

If your Discord feels like a corporate HR training, people will leave. If it feels like a guilt-trip factory, people will burn out. If it's all doom and no hope, people will disengage.

**Balance is key:**
- 60% practical work and coordination
- 20% community building and culture
- 10% victories and celebrations
- 10% venting and support

**Signs your server is getting too serious:**
- Every conversation becomes an argument
- People apologize excessively for casual comments
- Humor disappears
- New members are scared to post
- Moderators spend more time policing tone than building culture

**Fix:** More #general chat, more #memes, more voice hangouts doing nothing important.

---

## Part 4: Onboarding & Growth

### The New Member Experience

**First 5 minutes determine retention.**

When someone joins your server, they should see:

1. **Welcome message** (automated, in #welcome)
   ```
   Welcome @NewPerson! 👋
   
   This server coordinates mutual aid and local organizing in [YOUR AREA].
   
   Start here:
   → Read #how-this-works
   → Introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself
   → Assign yourself roles in #role-selection
   → Jump into #general or check #requests
   
   Questions? Tag @Moderator
   ```

2. **Clear next steps** (in #how-this-works)
   - What this server is for
   - How decisions get made
   - How to get involved
   - How to ask for/offer help
   - Community guidelines

3. **Easy first action** (self-assigning roles)
   - Let them pick skills/interests immediately
   - Makes them visible to community
   - Gives them sense of contribution

**Common onboarding mistakes:**
- ❌ Wall of text in welcome channel
- ❌ Too many channels without explanation
- ❌ Requiring application/vetting before participation
- ❌ No clear first action
- ❌ Assuming people know activist jargon

### Growth Strategy: The Concentric Circles

**Your server will have layers. Design for this.**

```
CORE (5-15 people)
├─ The coordinators who do most organizing
├─ Weekly meetings, high trust, lots of access
└─ These are your "guild officers"

ACTIVE (30-50 people)
├─ Regular participants in actions
├─ Show up when called, contribute skills
└─ These are your "raiders"

ENGAGED (100-200 people)
├─ Follow along, occasional participation
├─ Share resources, boost signal
└─ These are your "guild members"

LURKERS (500+ people)
├─ Silent observers, potential future actives
├─ Read but don't post much
└─ These are fine! They're learning.
```

**Don't try to turn lurkers into core members directly.**

**The path is:** Lurker → Engaged (through easy asks) → Active (through successful experiences) → Core (through proven commitment)

**Design onramps for each transition:**
- Lurker → Engaged: Share a resource, react to posts
- Engaged → Active: Attend one event, fulfill one request
- Active → Core: Lead one action, coordinate one project

### When to Split Servers

**Your gaming guild probably had multiple servers: main server, hardcore raiders, casual players, maybe alt-faction server.**

**Same principle applies. Split when:**

1. **Geographic divide** - Different cities need different coordination
2. **Action type divide** - Electoral work vs. direct action need different security
3. **Culture clash** - Some people want chill hangout, others want hardcore organizing
4. **Size limit** - Over 500 actives makes coordination hard

**How to split without fracturing:**
- Keep one "alliance" server with representatives from each split
- Cross-post major announcements
- Hold occasional joint events
- Share resources freely between servers

---

## Part 5: Moderation & Conflict

### You Already Know This

**Toxic players in gaming = bad actors in organizing**

The behaviors are identical:
- Dominate conversations
- Dismiss others' contributions
- Create drama for attention
- Rules-lawyer to avoid accountability
- "Just joking" when called out
- Recruit others into their beef

**Your guild-management skills transfer directly:**

1. **Document everything**
   - DM logs, message screenshots, pattern tracking
   - Just like you documented ninja looters

2. **Graduated response**
   - Verbal warning → Timeout → Temp ban → Permanent ban
   - Same structure as your gaming server

3. **Transparent process**
   - Rules in #how-this-works
   - Warnings in mod logs
   - Appeal process for bans

4. **Trust your gut**
   - If someone makes the server worse, they shouldn't be there
   - Community comfort > one person's participation

### The "One Bad Apple" Rule

In gaming: One toxic player drives away ten good players.

In organizing: One toxic activist drives away ten potential organizers.

**Don't sacrifice community health for "unity."**

### Conflict vs. Abuse

**You learned this distinction in guilds:**

**Conflict** (normal, healthy):
- Disagreements about strategy
- Different priorities or timelines
- Personality clashes
- Resource allocation debates

**Abuse** (remove it):
- Personal attacks
- Harassment
- Doxxing or threats
- Deliberate sabotage
- Pattern of making others feel unsafe

**Manage conflict. Eliminate abuse.**

### De-escalation Techniques

**From voice chat raids to tense organizing calls:**

1. **Timeout the situation**
   - "Let's take 10 minutes, come back calm"
   - Same as calling for a wipe and reset

2. **Move to DMs**
   - "Let's sort this privately"
   - Prevents public pile-ons

3. **Focus on behavior, not person**
   - "That comment was hurtful" not "You're an asshole"
   - Same as "That pull was bad" not "You're a bad tank"

4. **Bring in neutral third party**
   - Another moderator who isn't involved
   - Like calling in another guild officer

---

## Part 6: Voice Channels & Real-Time Coordination

### Why Voice Matters

**Text is for asynchronous work. Voice is for building trust and coordinating action.**

Your gaming server probably had:
- Voice channels for raids (focused work)
- Voice channels for hanging out (social bonding)
- Separate channels for different groups
- Maybe streaming/screen-share for teaching

**Your organizing server needs the same:**

```
🔊 VOICE CHANNELS
├─ 🎯 Strategy Session - For focused planning
├─ 🤝 Open Hangout - Drop in, casual chat
├─ 🛠️ Working Session - Co-working space
├─ 📚 Study Hall - Learning together
└─ 🎮 Gaming/Social - Yes, include this
```

### Voice Channel Culture

**From raid leading to action coordination:**

**During focused work:**
- Clear agenda at start
- One person facilitates
- Mute when not speaking
- Use hand-raise reactions
- Take notes in text channel

**During social time:**
- Drop in/out freely
- Multiple conversations okay
- Background music if desired
- Play games together
- Build relationships

**The social channels matter as much as the work channels.** This is where people become friends, not just comrades.

### Virtual Events That Work

**Adapt your guild events:**

| Gaming Event | Organizing Event | Why It Works |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Raid night | Action planning | Regular rhythm |
| Movie night | Documentary watch party | Education + social |
| Achievement runs | Campaign sprint | Concentrated effort |
| PvP tournaments | Debate/discussion | Healthy competition |
| Social hangout | Just vibing | Relationship building |
| New player help | Onboarding sessions | Skill transfer |

**Run events at consistent times. People plan around them.**

---

## Part 7: Security & Privacy

### Different Threat Model, Same Principles

**In gaming:** You worried about account hacks, doxxing by toxic players, server raids.

**In organizing:** You worry about surveillance, infiltration, legal exposure.

**The basics are similar:**

### Essential Security Practices

1. **Verification for sensitive channels**
   - #requests and #offers can be public
   - #action-planning needs verified members
   - #legal-support needs strong vetting
   
2. **Separate servers for different risk levels**
   - Public server for mutual aid (low risk)
   - Private server for direct action (higher risk)
   - Signal groups for high-risk coordination
   
3. **Teach security culture**
   - No full names if possible
   - No location pins in photos
   - No discussing illegal activity in Discord
   - #security-culture channel with resources

4. **Bot permissions audit**
   - Check what data bots can access
   - Remove unnecessary bot permissions
   - Don't use bots that log everything

### When Discord Isn't Enough

**Discord is corporate infrastructure. It can be subpoenaed.**

For high-risk organizing, you need:
- **Signal** for encrypted messaging
- **Jitsi** or **Mumble** for encrypted voice
- **Cryptpad** for encrypted documents
- **Protonmail** for encrypted email

**But for most mutual aid and local organizing, Discord is fine.**

**Just know the limits:**
- Assume law enforcement can read everything
- Don't discuss anything illegal
- Use Signal for anything truly sensitive

---

## Part 8: Bots & Automation Examples

### Mutual Aid Request Bot (MEE6 Custom Commands)

```
!request [category] [description]
Example: !request food "Need groceries for family of 4, can pick up"

Bot posts to #requests with:
- Auto-assigned category tag
- Timestamp
- User who requested
- React with ✅ when fulfilled
```

### Skills Database (Google Sheets + Bot)

Use **YAGPDB** or similar to connect a spreadsheet:

```
!addskill [skill]
!findhelp [skill]
!myskills

Example:
> !findhelp carpentry
Bot: "3 people have carpentry: @Person1, @Person2, @Person3"
```

### Meeting Scheduler (Sesh + Timezone Bot)

```
!event create
Title: Weekly Strategy Meeting
Date: Next Monday 7pm
Duration: 1 hour

Bot:
- Converts to all member timezones
- Sends reminder 24h before
- Sends reminder 1h before
- Creates temporary voice channel automatically
```

### Shift Signup Bot (Custom via YAGPDB)

For ongoing projects (food pantry, tool library, etc.):

```
!signup [shift name]
!signuplist [shift name]

Example: Community Garden Saturday Slots
React with 🌱 for 9am-12pm
React with 🌻 for 12pm-3pm
React with 🌾 for 3pm-6pm
```

---

## Part 9: From Online to Offline

### The Ultimate Goal: IRL

**Discord is the coordination layer. Physical presence is the action layer.**

Your gaming guild probably had:
- Online raids most nights
- Occasional IRL meetups for major events
- Discord for coordination, real life for celebration

**Organizing needs the opposite ratio:**
- Regular IRL action
- Discord for coordination between actions
- Real life for the work, Discord for the logistics

### First IRL Event: Keep It Simple

**Don't try to jump straight to "organizing action."**

**Start social:**
- Picnic in a park
- Game night at someone's house
- Bar meetup
- Community cleanup (low-stakes service)

**Why?** Because people need to like each other before they'll risk getting arrested together.

### The Hybrid Model

**Best organizing uses Discord like your guild used it:**

```
Monday-Thursday: Online coordination
- Check #requests daily
- Coordinate resource sharing
- Plan next action
- Study/skill-share

Friday-Sunday: IRL action
- Mutual aid deliveries
- Community events
- Direct actions
- Celebration/social time
```

**Discord isn't a substitute for physical presence. It's the scaffolding that makes physical organizing more effective.**

## Part 10: When Your Gaming Community Becomes Your Organizing Community

### The Natural Evolution

**You're reading this because you already have a community.** Gaming Discord, friend group server, hobby community.

**How do you transition from "we play games together" to "we build alternatives together"?**

### The Gentle Pivot Strategy

**Don't kill the fun. Add the function.**

1. **Create an #off-topic-mutual-aid channel**
   - Frame it as "if anyone needs help with anything"
   - Start with small stuff: moving help, tech support, food when sick
   - Build culture of reciprocity

2. **Add skill-sharing**
   - Already teaching each other game mechanics?
   - Start teaching each other life skills
   - #skill-share channel for tutorials

3. **Local action emerges naturally**
   - "Anyone going to the protest Saturday?"
   - "Who wants to volunteer at food bank?"
   - Don't force it, just create space

4. **Spin off if needed**
   - Keep gaming server for gaming
   - Create "IRL stuff" server for organizing
   - Overlap is fine, separation prevents conflict

### Case Study: From Geoguessr to Mutual Aid

*Real example from the UK:*

**Started:** Friend group playing Geoguessr and other casual games on Discord

**Evolution:**
1. Someone mentioned struggling with bills → others offered help
2. Created #mutual-support channel
3. Started sharing local resources (food banks, free services)
4. Organized first IRL meetup (pub social)
5. Someone suggested community garden workday
6. Now coordinates local mutual aid network

**Timeline:** 18 months

**Key:** Never stopped gaming. Added organizing as parallel track.

## Part 12: Troubleshooting Common Problems

### "Nobody Posts Anything"

**The Ghost Town Server**

**Why it happens:**
- People waiting for others to post first
- Unclear what's appropriate to share
- No established rhythm
- Fear of judgment

**Fix:**
1. Post consistently yourself (daily, same time)
2. Ask specific questions
3. Share vulnerable/casual stuff, not just "important" content
4. Create daily prompts ("What's everyone working on today?")
5. Celebrate any posting ("Great question!" reactions)

### "Too Much Noise"

**When everything is urgent**

**Why it happens:**
- No triage system
- Unclear channel purposes
- People post everywhere
- No way to filter

**Fix:**
1. Clear channel descriptions
2. Use threads for detailed discussions
3. Create #urgent channel for actual emergencies
4. Pin important announcements
5. Weekly digest to reduce daily noise

### "Drama Is Killing The Server"

**Interpersonal conflict dominates**

**Why it happens:**
- No conflict resolution process
- Public arguments escalate
- Taking sides becomes sport
- Moderators scared to act

**Fix:**
1. Move conflicts to DMs immediately
2. Clear consequence ladder (warning → timeout → ban)
3. Ban the behavior, not the person (first time)
4. Don't be afraid to remove persistent problems
5. Focus channel on wins, not grievances

### "We're Organized Online But Nothing Happens IRL"

**Discord isn't translating to action**

**Why it happens:**
- No clear calls to action
- Too much planning, not enough doing
- Fear of being "the one who goes first"
- Coordination without commitment

**Fix:**
1. Set recurring IRL events (same time/place monthly)
2. Make RSVPs binding (soft accountability)
3. Start ridiculously small (coffee meetup before protest)
4. Assign explicit roles/tasks before events
5. Document and celebrate every IRL action

### "The Core Team Is Burning Out"

**Same 5 people doing everything**

**Why it happens:**
- Unclear how to help
- Coordinator gatekeeping (unintentional)
- No onboarding to responsibility
- Guilt about saying no

**Fix:**
1. Explicit "help wanted" posts
2. Small, concrete tasks anyone can grab
3. Share the moderation duties
4. Celebrate people stepping up
5. Give coordinators permission to rest

---

## Part 13: Scaling Beyond One Server

### When You Need an Alliance

**Your server works. Others are starting similar servers in other cities/regions.**

**How to federate without bureaucracy:**

**The Alliance Server Model:**

```
CITY/REGIONAL SERVERS (Autonomous)
├─ Reading Mutual Aid Discord
├─ Manchester Organizing Server
├─ Bristol Direct Action
└─ Liverpool Commons

ALLIANCE SERVER (Coordination)
├─ #announcements (cross-server news)
├─ #resource-sharing (what worked where)
├─ #joint-actions (multi-city campaigns)
└─ #reps-only (one rep from each server)
```

**Key principles:**
1. Each local server stays autonomous
2. Alliance server is for coordination only
3. No central authority, just shared resources
4. Opt-in participation in joint actions
5. Open-source all organizing tech/templates

### The Network Effect

**Once you have 3+ allied servers:**

- Share successful tactics across regions
- Coordinate regional actions
- Resource pooling (bulk purchases, shared tools)
- Mutual aid across distance (evacuations, refugees, etc.)
- Cross-training and skill-shares

**This is how movements scale without NGO infrastructure.**

## Final Thoughts: You Already Have the Skills

Traditional organizers will tell you that running a Discord server isn't "real organizing."

They're wrong.

**You've built communities. You've coordinated complex group activities. You've managed resources, mediated conflicts, and kept people engaged through hard times.**

**Those are literally the core skills of organizing.**

The only difference is that instead of coordinating a 40-person raid to defeat a dragon, you're coordinating a 40-person mutual aid network to defeat eviction.

The dragon is different. The tactics are the same.

**You don't need to learn organizing from scratch. You need to translate what you already know.**

This appendix gave you the translation guide.

Now go build your local server. Start with 5 friends. See what happens.

**Remember:** The oligarchy has billion-dollar surveillance infrastructure and professional security teams.

We have Discord servers and friends who care about each other.

**And historically, we keep winning.**

Because they have to monitor everything. We just have to organize anything.

Let's get to work.
