# Appendix A: The Rigged Board Diagnostic
**One-page worksheet for mapping power in your city**

---

## ✅ Before You Start (5-Minute Prep)

**Open these now:**
- [ ] Your council's website
- [ ] A blank spreadsheet (Google Sheets or Excel)
- [ ] A notepad or document for notes
- [ ] Set a timer for **2 hours maximum**

**Commit to this:**
*This is orientation, not a PhD.*
*Strategic direction beats perfect data.*
*Done this weekend beats perfect never.*

---

## Purpose

**Before you organize, you need to see the board.**

This diagnostic helps you map:
- Who has power (decision-makers)
- Where money flows (follow the funding)
- What's extracting (parasitic relationships)
- Where leverage exists (intervention points)

**Time required:** 2-3 hours of research
**Tools needed:** Spreadsheet, council website, Companies House, local news archive

**Do this before Week 1 protocol in Chapter 20.**

---

## Section 1: Who Holds Power?

**Local Council Mapping**

| Role | Name | Party | Email | Phone | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Leader of Council | | | | | |
| Cabinet Member: Housing | | | | | |
| Cabinet Member: Planning | | | | | |
| Cabinet Member: Finance | | | | | |
| Cabinet Member: Health/Wellbeing | | | | | |
| Cabinet Member: Environment | | | | | |
| Your Ward Councillor | | | | | |
| Opposition Leaders | | | | | |

**Find this info:** [Your City] Council website → "Councillors" or "Cabinet"

**Why it matters:** These are your entry points for Chapter 17 playbooks. Start with Housing, Planning, or Environment—they control physical space.

---

**Informal Power Brokers**

Who actually makes decisions (often different from official titles):

| Type | Name/Organization | Influence Area | Contact | Notes |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Developer with council ear | | | | Usually biggest donor to ruling party |
| Chamber of Commerce head | | | | Speaks for "business community" |
| University leadership | | | | Major landowner, employer |
| Local newspaper editor | | | | Frames narratives |
| Community foundation CEO | | | | Controls grant money |
| Major employer CEO | | | | Economic leverage |
| Faith leader (if influential) | | | | Moral authority |

**Find this info:** Local news archives, council meeting minutes, donation records, Companies House

**Companies House PSC Hack:** Search for "Persons with Significant Control" (PSC) register for every major developer in your city. You'll often find they're the same 3-5 families or offshore shells. **Name them.** This reveals the network.

**Why it matters:** Official power vs. actual power. You need both maps.

---

**Quick Triage: Red Flags vs. Green Flags**

Before approaching anyone, scan for these patterns:

| **Green Flags (Potential Ally)** | **Red Flags (Avoid/Delay)** |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Has publicly criticized extractive development | Is major donor to ruling party |
| Champions community-led projects | Has family ties to major developers |
| Works with tenant unions or co-ops | Owns significant speculative land |
| Supports cooperative business models | Lobbies against affordable housing quotas |
| Voted against austerity cuts | Voted for austerity cuts consistently |
| No landlord portfolio | Landlord portfolio > 5 units |
| Attends community meetings | Only appears at election time |
| Criticizes developer-led solutions | Repeats "jobs and growth" script |

**Use this to prioritize your outreach.** Green flags first. Red flags: friendly but cautious.

---

## Section 2: Follow the Money

**Council Budget Analysis**

| Budget Area | Annual £ | % of Total | Controlled By | Notes |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Housing | | | | |
| Planning & Development | | | | |
| Environment/Parks | | | | |
| Social Services | | | | |
| Economic Development | | | | |
| Community Grants | | | | |
| **Total Budget** | | 100% | | |

**Find this info:** [Your City] Council → "Budget" or "Finance" → Annual budget document (usually February)

**Why it matters:** This shows where money already flows. Sanctuary districts are "Environment/Parks" line item. CLTs are "Housing" line item. You're not asking for new money—you're redirecting existing flows.

---

**Major Local Developments (Last 3 Years)**

| Project | Developer | Value | Public £ | Private £ | Outcome | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |

**Find this info:** Planning applications, local news, council planning committee minutes

**Why it matters:** Shows extraction patterns. Developer gets planning permission → builds luxury flats → sells at market rate → profits leave city → affordable housing crisis worsens. That's the script. Your interventions interrupt it.

---

**Who Funds What**

| Organization | Annual Budget | Funding Sources | Influence On | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Local university | | Government grants, tuition | Land use, development, employment | |
| Major employer | | Revenue | Jobs, political leverage | |
| Community foundation | | Endowment, donations | Grants to local orgs | |
| Housing associations | | Rents, government | Social housing | |
| Chamber of Commerce | | Member fees | Business lobby | |

**Find this info:** Annual reports (often on organization websites), charity commission for nonprofits

**Why it matters:** Shows where alternative funding could come from. University has endowment? Potential CLT funder. Community foundation? Potential sanctuary pilot funder.

---

## Section 3: Extraction Mapping

**Where Value Leaves Your City**

| Type | Specific Example | Annual Value (est.) | Who Benefits | Notes |
|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Housing** | Private landlords, corporate ownership | £ | Shareholders outside city | Rent extraction |
| **Retail** | Chain stores vs. local shops | £ | Corporate headquarters | Profit extraction |
| **Employment** | Zero-hour contracts, wage suppression | £ | Shareholders | Labor exploitation |
| **Utilities** | Private water, energy, transport | £ | Investors | Monopoly rent |
| **Finance** | Payday loans, rent-to-own | £ | Predatory lenders | Poverty tax |
| **Development** | Luxury housing for investors | £ | Developers, investors | Gentrification |
| **Land** | Speculative holding | £ | Property speculators | Underuse |
| **Attention** | Local news owned by national chain | £ | Media conglomerates | Narrative control |

**How to estimate:**
- Housing: Average rent × number of private rental units × 12 months
- Retail: Assume 70% of chain revenue leaves city (reasonable estimate)
- Employment: (Living wage - actual wage) × workers in precarious jobs
- Utilities: Annual bills - operating costs = profit extraction
- Finance: APR on payday loans vs. credit union rates × loan volume
- Development: Market rate - build cost = developer profit
- Land: Vacant land value - council tax paid = speculative holding value
- Attention: Ad revenue from local coverage owned by nationals

---

**Housing Extraction Quick Math (10-Minute Estimate)**

Can't find exact data? Use this shortcut:

1. **Go to Zoopla** → "To Rent" → Your City → Note "Average Rent" (e.g., £1,200 pcm)
2. **Check council stats** for "Private rented households" (usually in census data or council website) (e.g., 30,000)
3. **Formula:** Average Rent × 12 × Private Rentals × 0.3 (assume 30% leaves city as profit)
4. **Example:** £1,200 × 12 × 30,000 × 0.3 = **£129.6M/year extraction**

**That's your baseline housing extraction number. Use it in every pitch.**

---

**The Extraction Index (Your Headline Metric)**

This single number tells you if your city is structurally broken:

**Formula:** (Average Rent in City × 12) ÷ (Average Local Salary after tax)

**Example:**
- Average rent: £1,200/month = £14,400/year
- Average salary after tax: £24,000/year
- **Extraction Index: £14,400 ÷ £24,000 = 0.60 (60%)**

**If the result is > 0.40 (40%), the city is structurally extracting life from its workers.**

**This is your headline metric.** Use it in every council pitch, every media interview, every community meeting.

"60% of take-home pay goes to landlords. That's not a housing market—that's wealth extraction."

---

**Why it matters:** This is what you're stopping. Every £1 that stops leaving = £1 available for community reinvestment. This is the business case for your interventions.

---

**Quantify the Hemorrhage**

Total annual extraction (sum of above): **£__________**

Population of your city: **__________**

**Extraction per resident per year: £__________**

**For a family of 4: £__________ per year leaves the local economy**

**This is not abstract. This is wealth transfer. This is the rigged game.**

---

## Section 4: Crisis Points (Your Leverage)

**What's Breaking Right Now?**

| Crisis | Severity (1-10) | Who's Affected | Current "Solution" | Why It Fails | Your Intervention |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Housing waiting list | | | | | CLT |
| High street vacancies | | | | | Co-ops |
| Mental health demand | | | | | Sanctuary |
| Youth unemployment | | | | | Co-op jobs |
| Attention extraction | | | | | Cognitive sovereignty |
| Precarious work | | | | | AUBI pilot |

**Find this info:**
- Council reports (usually annual "State of the City" type documents)
- NHS data (mental health waiting times, demand)
- High street surveys (vacancy rates)
- Local news (what's the recurring crisis?)

**Why it matters:** Crisis creates political will. When systems are failing, people are open to alternatives. Your interventions are solutions to their crises.

---

**Crisis Severity Scorecard**

**Objective ranking to remove guesswork:**

| Crisis | Data Available? (1/0) | Public Anger? (1-5) | Council Failure? (1-5) | **Total Score** |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Housing waiting list | | | | |
| High street vacancies | | | | |
| Mental health demand | | | | |
| Youth unemployment | | | | |
| Attention extraction | | | | |
| Precarious work | | | | |

**Scoring guide:**
- **Data Available:** 1 if you can find numbers (council reports, NHS, census), 0 if not
- **Public Anger:** 1 = no one cares, 5 = people are furious, it's in local news constantly
- **Council Failure:** 1 = council handling well, 5 = tried multiple times, all failed

**Highest score = your entry point.** No subjectivity, just strategic math.

---

**The Strategic Opportunity**

Pick ONE crisis from above that:
1. Is visible (people actually care)
2. Has failed solutions (council tried, didn't work)
3. Maps to your intervention (sanctuary, CLT, co-op, AUBI)
4. Has a sympathetic councillor (see Section 1)

**Your target crisis:** _________________________________

**Why this one:** _________________________________

**Which councillor to approach:** _________________________________

**Your intervention:** _________________________________

**This is your entry point.**

---

## Section 5: Ally Mapping

**Who's Already Trying?**

| Organization | Type | Focus Area | Contact | Capacity | Relationship |
|--------------|------|------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Existing co-ops | Worker-owned | Various | | Busy but aligned | Partner |
| Community groups | Volunteer | Housing/environment | | Willing but limited | Support |
| Faith communities | Religious | Social justice | | Values-aligned | Potential ally |
| University orgs | Student | Various causes | | High energy, short-term | Tactical support |
| Tenant unions | Advocacy | Housing | | Directly aligned | Core partner |
| Environmental groups | Activism | Green space | | Overlapping interest | Sanctuary allies |
| Credit unions | Financial | Alternative banking | | Established infrastructure | Funding partner |

**Find this info:** Council "voluntary sector directory", local news, social media

**Why it matters:** You're not starting from zero. These are your Ring 2. They're already organizing, just not coordinated. Your job: coordination.

---

**Competition or Allies?**

Some groups might seem like competition (also working on housing, also organizing community). 

**The test:**
- Do they share your values (community ownership, not extraction)?
- Are they willing to collaborate (not territorial)?
- Do they have different strengths (you coordinate, they have networks)?

**If yes to all three:** Allies, not competition.
**If no to any:** Keep friendly distance, don't burn bridges, but don't depend on them.

---

## Section 6: Leverage Point Analysis

**Where Small Input Creates Big Change**

| Leverage Point | Type | Why It Matters | Effort Required | Impact Potential | Priority |
|----------------|------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Sympathetic councillor | Political | Can table motions | Low (coffee meeting) | High (institutional access) | 1 |
| Failing council asset | Physical | Need solution anyway | Medium (proposal) | High (proof of concept) | 2 |
| Community group network | Social | Existing trust | Low (coordination) | Medium (mobilization) | 3 |
| Local media attention | Narrative | Frame the story | Medium (press work) | Medium (legitimacy) | 4 |
| Funding opportunity | Financial | Unlocks pilots | High (grant writing) | High (enables action) | 5 |
| Crisis moment | Political | Creates urgency | Low (timing) | High (opens doors) | Variable |

**Rank these for your city.** What's your easiest high-impact leverage point?

**Your top 3 leverage points:**
1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________
3. _________________________________

**These are what Week 1 protocol targets.**

---

## How to Use This Diagnostic

**Step 1: Research (2-3 hours)**
Fill out all sections. Use council websites, news archives, Companies House, Charity Commission.

**Step 2: Analyze (30 minutes)**
Look for patterns:
- Where's the extraction most obvious?
- Who benefits? (Follow the money)
- What's the crisis they can't solve?
- Who's sympathetic to alternatives?

**Step 3: Synthesize (15 minutes)**
Complete Section 7 (One-Page Summary).

**Step 4: Act (Week 1)**
Use your synthesis to execute Week 1 protocol from Chapter 20:
- Monday: Email the key councillor about the crisis/intervention
- Tuesday: Schedule coffee with Ring 1 candidates
- Wednesday: Meet with potential ally organization
- Thursday: Document findings, start tracking
- Friday: Identify funding sources

**This diagnostic transforms abstract analysis into concrete action.**

---

## Example: Completed Diagnostic (Reading, UK)

**Power Holders:**
- Key councillor: Cllr Rachel Eden (Cabinet Member for Housing)
- Informal power broker: University of Reading (major landowner)

**Money Flows:**
- Council budget: £181M annually
- Housing budget: £47M (affordable housing, homelessness prevention)
- Estimated extraction: £180M/year (housing £140M, retail £25M, employment £15M)

**Crisis Point:**
- 14,000 on housing waiting list, average wait 7 years
- Council can't afford to build, developers only build luxury
- CLT intervention: community-owned permanently affordable housing

**Allies:**
- Reading Refugee Support Group (community organizing experience)
- Reading University Students' Union (labor, energy, networks)
- Earley & Woodley Friends of the Earth (environmental focus, overlaps with sanctuary)

**Leverage Points:**
1. Sympathetic councillor (Eden has criticized developer-led housing)
2. Failed council assets (empty lots council can't afford to develop)
3. National Lottery funding available for CLT pilots

**Extraction Pattern:**
Private landlords extract £140M/year from renters. Money flows to shareholders in London, not reinvested locally. Creates housing crisis, precarity, no local wealth accumulation.

**First Move:**
Email Cllr Eden about CLT pilot on council-owned site in Whitley. Reference Preston model, offer costings, request 15-minute meeting.

---

## Can't Find the Data? (Fallback Strategies)

**Don't let missing data stop you. Here's what to do:**

**Budget numbers unknown?**
- Use last year's headline figure from local news
- Or: Email council finance department directly ("FOI request: total council budget")
- Direction matters more than precision

**No extraction estimates?**
- Use the **Housing Quick Math** from Section 3
- It's usually 60-80% of total extraction anyway
- Conservative estimate beats no estimate

**Don't know who the allies are?**
- Search "[Your city] community land trust"
- Search "[Your city] cooperative network"
- Search "[Your city] tenant union"
- If none exist: **You're the first. That's leverage, not a problem.**

**Can't find crisis data?**
- Local newspaper archive search: "[Your city] housing crisis"
- Council meeting minutes: Search "waiting list" or "mental health"
- MPs' constituency surgeries (they track recurring complaints)

**Informal power brokers unclear?**
- Who donates to the ruling party? (Electoral Commission website)
- Who speaks at council planning meetings? (Meeting minutes)
- Who does the local paper quote as "business leader"?

**Better approximate data now than perfect data never.**

**If you're stuck after 3 hours, STOP researching and START acting.**

You have enough orientation. Send the first email.

---

## Warning: Don't Get Stuck in Analysis

**This diagnostic is a tool, not a project.**

🚨 **Analysis Paralysis Alert:**

Your goal is **strategic orientation**, not a doctoral thesis.

**If you spend more than 3 hours on this diagnostic, you're avoiding action.**

**Close the spreadsheet and send the first email.**

---

**Good use:** 2-3 hours research → synthesis → Week 1 action
**Bad use:** 2 months "researching" → never taking first move → analysis paralysis

**The point isn't perfect knowledge.**
**The point is sufficient orientation to act strategically.**

You don't need to map every power relationship.
You need to map enough to know:
- Who to email Monday
- What crisis creates your opening
- Which allies to recruit
- Where money could come from

**Done is better than perfect.**

**Complete this diagnostic over one weekend.**
**Then start Week 1 protocol Monday morning.**

**No excuses.**

---

## Updates and Iterations

**This is a living document.**

As you organize, you'll learn:
- Which councillors are actually sympathetic (not just polite)
- Where money really flows (not just official budgets)
- Who's trustworthy in your Ring 2 (not just friendly)
- What leverage actually exists (not just what looked promising)

**Update this quarterly:**
- New councillors elected? Update Section 1
- Budget changed? Update Section 2
- New crisis emerged? Update Section 4
- New allies appeared? Update Section 5

**The board keeps changing. Your map must keep updating.**

---

**Advanced Option: Build a Digital Twin**

**If you're tech-savvy, consider visualizing this as a network:**

**Tools:**
- **Obsidian** (knowledge graph, free)
- **Kumu.io** (network mapping, free tier)
- **Miro** (visual board, free tier)

**Why?** When you draw the lines between Developer → Councillor → Bank → Media, the "corruption" stops looking like a conspiracy and starts looking like a **circuit board**.

**And you can rewire a circuit board.**

Connect each node (person/org) with relationships:
- Funds
- Employs
- Advises
- Donates to
- Owns
- Regulates

**You're not just making a list. You're building a database.**

The pattern becomes visible. The leverage points become obvious.

---

## Final Note: Why This Matters

**Every successful organizer does this mapping, formally or informally.**

Preston mapped their anchor institutions before building community wealth.
Bristol mapped vacant council land before launching sanctuary pilots.
Granby residents mapped landlord ownership before forming their CLT.

**The difference between competent organizing and wishful thinking is knowing the terrain.**

You wouldn't win at Geoguessr without learning some meta-game.
You wouldn't lift weights without tracking progression.
You wouldn't moderate Discord without understanding the power dynamics.

**Same principle applies to civic organizing.**

**This diagnostic is your strategic map.**

**Now fill it out and use it.**
