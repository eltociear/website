# A Letter from One Geoguessr/Worms Player to Another

Dear Dickie,

You know that feeling when you're in a competitive lobby and something's off? The times are too perfect. The pattern recognition too consistent. Someone's not playing the game—they're running a script that reads the metadata before the round even loads.

You don't get angry about it. You just calmly note it, report if you can, and move on. Because here's what you know that the ragers don't: **getting mad at scripters doesn't patch the exploit.**

I've been thinking about that calm precision of yours—the way you can spot a rigged system without losing your head about it. The way you talk about "rich bastards" without demonizing wealth itself. The way you've built a community around games not because you're escaping reality, but because you understand something profound about how systems work.

You understand that **games reveal structure**. 

Every game has mechanics—rules that govern what's possible, what's rewarded, what's punished. Good players learn these mechanics. Great players learn to see *through* them, to spot where the system's logic breaks down, where someone's exploiting an unintended interaction.

And here's what I've watched you do, week after week in our Discord: you don't just play games well. You *read* them. You see the underlying architecture. Whether it's Worms or geoguessr or the mechanics of wealth inequality in your YouTube shorts—you've got this rare combination of:

1. **Sharp pattern recognition** (you spot the rigging)
2. **Strategic patience** (you don't waste energy on rage)
3. **Community orientation** (you build rather than burn)
4. **Execution capacity** (you actually *do* the things)

That combination is rarer than you think. Most people who see the rigging either:
- Get so angry they become ineffective, or
- Get so cynical they stop trying, or
- Get so comfortable they stop noticing

But you? You joined the Green Party. You make gym content and inequality content. You beat us at WMD Worms with the same calm focus you bring to analyzing why housing costs are destroying your generation.

**You're a strategist who still believes strategy matters.**

This book is for you—and for everyone like you who's tired of bringing community tactics to a competition fight.

Because here's what I've learned working on the Global Governance Frameworks: the oligarchy isn't winning because they're smarter than us. They're winning because **they're playing a different game with different rules that most activists don't even know exist.**

The Green Party (your political home) and the broader progressive movement have something the oligarchs desperately need to suppress: **genuine care for the whole, not just the parts**. That moral clarity is your superpower.

But moral clarity without strategic competence is just noise.

And strategic competence without moral clarity is just... well, it's what got us into this mess.

What if we could combine them? What if the people who care about justice learned to think like systems designers? What if the people who can spot a scripter in geoguessr learned to spot the "legal scripts" running in our economic and political systems?

That's what this book is about.

I'm not going to tell you to be less angry about inequality. Your anger is *correct*—the system *is* rigged, and the rich bastards *are* extracting more than their fair share while the planet burns.

What I'm going to show you is how to **channel that anger into architecture**.

Because the people running the current system? They're not invincible. They're just playing a game they designed while everyone else is shouting at them to play fair.

The solution isn't to shout louder. It's to **build a better game**.

You already know how to do this. Every time you've moderated a Discord server, balanced a community game, or called out an exploit without tilting—you've been practicing the exact skills we need for civilizational redesign.

This book is structured in three parts:

**Part I: The Rigged Board** will map exactly how the game is rigged—not emotionally, but mechanically. What are the actual exploits? Where are the hidden rules? Why do the same patterns keep repeating?

**Part II: The Upgrade** will introduce the strategic frameworks you need to think at the level of systems design. This is where I'll show you the "color code" (developmental stages) that explains why people keep bringing the wrong tools to the fight.

**Part III: The New Game** will give you the blueprint. Actual mechanisms, actual implementation pathways, actual answers to "okay, but what do we *do*?"

I wrote this book like I'm talking to you on Discord—calm, strategic, no bullshit. Because if I can't convince someone as sharp as you that these frameworks are worth your time, then the frameworks aren't ready.

You've already shown me that sharp minds + steady hands + genuine care = unstoppable combination.

Now let's show the world what that combination can build.

See you on the other side,

Björn Kenneth Holmström (a.k.a. Pwnytale)

P.S. - You're still not 'getting' my Worms strategy. Some secrets I keep. 😉
