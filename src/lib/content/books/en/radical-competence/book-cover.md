# Radical Competence

## Strategic Activism for the Systems-Thinking Age

---

**Author:** Björn Kenneth Holmström

**Series:** The Spiral Series

**Edition:** First Edition • 2025

---

## About This Book

This is a field manual for activists who are tired of losing.

Not a manifesto. Not theory for theory's sake. A practical guide for people who want to build campaigns that actually work, organize communities that don't burn out, and develop the strategic thinking required to win in a rigged system.

You'll learn how to:
- Map power structures in three hours (Week Zero Protocol)
- Assess whether your campaign will actually integrate or just perform activism
- Build coalitions that span developmental stages without collapsing
- Design municipal interventions that can scale
- Avoid the traps that kill most organizing efforts

This book assumes you already know the world is broken. It focuses on what to do about it.

## Structure

**Part I: The Problem** (4 chapters)  
Why smart people keep losing and what we're actually fighting

**Part II: The Framework** (4 chapters)  
Tools for mapping reality and reading the developmental room

**Part III: The Strategy** (4 chapters)  
The Yellow Stack: integrated interventions that actually work

**Part IV: The Practice** (4 chapters)  
Municipal organizing, campaign design, and avoiding burnout

**Part V: The Movement** (4 chapters)  
Scaling from local nodes to civilizational transformation

**Appendices** (5 resources)  
Templates, tools, and references you can actually use

---

## Target Audience

This book is written for **Green-stage activists ready to develop Yellow-level strategic thinking** — people like Dickie in Reading, UK, who:
- Know the system is rigged
- Have tried organizing before and hit walls
- Are ready for systems-level analysis
- Want practical tools, not just theory
- Are tired of activist theater

If you're frustrated with ineffective organizing, ready to think strategically, and willing to do the actual work of building power — this book is for you.

## How to Use This Book

**If you're planning a campaign:**  
Start with Chapter 5 (Week Zero Protocol) and Chapter 6 (Rigged Board Diagnostic). Do the actual worksheets. Then read Part III for strategy.

**If you're mid-campaign and struggling:**  
Jump to Chapter 16 (Integration Scorecard) to diagnose what's wrong. Then read the relevant chapters in Part IV.

**If you're building for the long term:**  
Read straight through, but complete the tools in the appendices as you go.

**If you just want to understand the framework:**  
Read Part I (The Problem) and Part II (The Framework), then cherry-pick from the rest based on your needs.

## A Note on Spiral Dynamics

This book uses the Spiral Dynamics framework to understand different value systems and developmental stages. You don't need to master the theory to use the tools — practical application comes first, theory second.

If you want the deep dive, see **Appendix A: Spiral Dynamics Primer for Organizers**.

*For Dickie in Reading, UK, and everyone else who knows the system is rigged but wants to actually do something about it.*
