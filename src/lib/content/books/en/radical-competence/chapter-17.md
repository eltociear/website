# Chapter 17: Pilot Cities 2026-2030
**Ten named UK cities with exact playbooks—where to deploy your squad**

You've learned institutional infiltration (Chapter 15).
You've built your squad (Chapter 16).

Now comes the question every strategist must answer:

**Where do we fight?**

Not "everywhere at once" (that's how you lose).
Not "wherever feels good" (that's how you waste resources).

**Specific cities. Specific councillors. Specific sanctuaries. Specific timelines.**

This chapter names names. It identifies ten UK cities where conditions are ripe for transformation, tells you exactly which interventions to deploy first, which local actors to contact, and which crises to exploit.

**Welcome to your targeting package.**

---

## The Selection Criteria: Why These Ten Cities

**Not random. Not aspirational. Strategic.**

We selected these ten cities based on five criteria:

### Criterion 1: Progressive Political Opening

**What we're looking for:**
- Labour/Green/SNP/Plaid council majority (or coalition)
- Recent election of progressive councillors
- History of community activism
- Political will to experiment

**Why it matters:** You need political permission. Hostile councils will block everything. Progressive councils looking for solutions will partner.

### Criterion 2: Economic Pressure Creating Flexibility

**What we're looking for:**
- Austerity hitting hard (budget cuts, service reductions)
- Traditional industries declining
- Youth unemployment high
- Housing crisis acute

**Why it matters:** Crisis creates willingness to try new approaches. "We've tried everything, might as well try this" opens doors closed in good times.

### Criterion 3: Existing Organizing Infrastructure

**What we're looking for:**
- Active unions, housing campaigns, climate groups
- Cooperative businesses already operating
- Community land trusts or similar experiments
- Universities with engaged student populations

**Why it matters:** You're not starting from zero. You're accelerating existing movements. Much easier than building from scratch.

### Criterion 4: Geographic and Demographic Diversity

**What we're looking for:**
- Mix of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland
- Mix of large cities and mid-sized towns
- Mix of ethnic composition, age demographics
- Different economic bases (post-industrial, service, knowledge)

**Why it matters:** Need to prove model works across contexts. If only works in Brighton, not systemic. If works in Bradford AND Bristol AND Belfast, it's replicable.

### Criterion 5: Realistic Resource Requirements

**What we're looking for:**
- Cities where £50K-200K can launch meaningful pilots
- Where 50-100 organized people can shift council decisions
- Where 2-5 years gets visible results

**Why it matters:** We're building proof of concept, not utopia. Need quick wins that can scale, not decades-long struggles.

## The Ten Pilot Cities

Listed roughly south to north, with priority ranking (★★★ = highest priority, ★★ = medium, ★ = longer-term):

1. **Bristol** ★★★
2. **Reading** ★★★
3. **Liverpool** ★★★
4. **Sheffield** ★★
5. **Bradford** ★★
6. **Preston** ★★
7. **Newcastle** ★★
8. **Glasgow** ★★★
9. **Dundee** ★
10. **Cardiff** ★★

**Why these rankings:**
- ★★★ (Top priority): Best combination of all five criteria, deploy resources here first
- ★★ (Medium priority): Strong on some criteria, need more groundwork on others
- ★ (Longer-term): Good potential but requires patient organizing

**The Five City Archetypes:**

Each of the 10 cities represents a type that can be replicated elsewhere:

| Archetype | Pilot Cities | Applicable To | Key Characteristics |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Green/Tech Incubator** | Bristol, Reading | Brighton, Cambridge, Oxford, Bath | University cities, progressive councils, tech workforce, housing crisis, strong Green presence |
| **Post-Industrial Fortress** | Liverpool, Preston, Bradford, Sheffield, Newcastle | Manchester, Leeds, Sunderland, Stoke, Hull, Middlesbrough, Swansea | Former manufacturing centers, Labour strongholds, cooperative tradition, economic transition, poverty/inequality high |
| **Devolved Powerhouse** | Glasgow, Dundee, Cardiff | Edinburgh, Belfast, Wrexham | Capital cities or major devolved regions, different powers than England, progressive national governments, policy innovation opportunity |
| **Mid-Size Innovator** | Preston, Dundee | Coventry, Derby, Luton, Plymouth, Wolverhampton | 100K-200K population, manageable size, underdog narrative, looking for identity/innovation, can move fast |
| **Regional Hub** | Newcastle, Sheffield, Glasgow | Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Edinburgh, Belfast | Major cities for their regions, multiple universities, strong civic identity, media attention, can influence wider region |

**How to use this:**
1. Identify which archetype matches your city
2. Use that archetype's pilot city playbook as template
3. Adapt to your local context (different councillors, different organizations, but same strategy)

**Example adaptations:**
- **Brighton** (not in the ten): Use Bristol playbook (Green/Tech Incubator archetype)
- **Manchester** (not in the ten): Use Liverpool or Sheffield playbook (Post-Industrial + Regional Hub)
- **Edinburgh** (not in the ten): Use Glasgow playbook (Devolved Powerhouse)
- **Plymouth** (not in the ten): Use Preston or Dundee playbook (Mid-Size Innovator)

**The principle:** These 10 cities aren't exclusive targets—they're **proof-of-concept templates** that work in different contexts. If your city matches an archetype, the playbook transfers.

| If You're In... | Start With... | Because... | Archetype |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Bristol** | Ecological Sanctuary | Strong Green/Lab coalition, housing crisis acute | Green/Tech Incubator |
| **Reading** | Cognitive Sovereignty | Tech/office workforce, digital wellness demand | Green/Tech Incubator |
| **Liverpool** | CLT Scaling | Already has Granby CLT—expand success | Post-Industrial Fortress |
| **Sheffield** | Sanctuary Network | Green space abundance, outdoor city brand | Post-Industrial + Regional Hub |
| **Bradford** | Faith-Based Sanctuary | Strong faith networks, cohesion opportunity | Post-Industrial Fortress |
| **Preston** | Add Cognitive Sovereignty | Already has economic model—complete the stack | Mid-Size Innovator |
| **Newcastle** | High Street Co-ops | Strong identity, retail crisis, cooperative tradition | Regional Hub |
| **Glasgow** | Scottish Land Fund | Devolved powers, funding already exists | Devolved Powerhouse |
| **Dundee** | Whole-City Pilot | Small, manageable, innovative reputation | Mid-Size Innovator |
| **Cardiff** | Wales Co-op Centre | National infrastructure, bilingual opportunity | Devolved Powerhouse |

**First Intervention: Ecological Sanctuary Pilot**

**Location:** Eastville Park or Troopers Hill (council-owned green space)

**The Pitch (use with councillors):**
"We propose a £50K pilot: Transform [site] into community-managed nature reserve with:
- Biodiversity restoration (tree planting, wildflower meadows)
- Community governance (residents manage via land trust)
- Educational programs (schools, Forest School sessions)
- Mental health benefits (green prescription, nature therapy)

Similar to [Avon Wildlife Trust] but community-owned. Addresses climate emergency declaration while building local capacity. 12-month pilot, full evaluation."

**Budget breakdown:**
- Legal (land trust setup): £5K
- Ecological survey & design: £10K
- Initial planting & infrastructure: £25K
- Community engagement & training: £5K
- Monitoring & evaluation: £5K

**Funding sources:**
- Council green spaces budget (£20K)
- National Lottery Community Fund (£20K)
- Crowdfunding (£10K)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-2: Council approval process, community consultation
- Months 3-4: Legal setup, ecological survey
- Months 5-6: Initial implementation, first plantings
- Months 6-12: Community training, governance establishment

**Success metrics:**
- Legal entity established (land trust)
- 50+ community members involved
- Council approval for expansion
- Media coverage (Bristol Cable, local press)

**Phase 2: Expansion (Months 7-18, 2026-2027)**

**Second Intervention: Cognitive Sovereignty Pilot**

**Target:** Tech workers, students, office workers (Bristol has 30K+ tech sector jobs)

**The Pitch:**
"Screen addiction is a public health crisis. We propose £30K pilot:
- 'Digital Detox' zones (phone-free cafes, libraries, community centers)
- 'Right to Disconnect' policy (council employees pilot)
- Educational workshops (schools, businesses)
- Community accountability groups

Addresses mental health crisis, models policy for private sector, builds movement."

**Location:** Central Library, Stokes Croft Community Centre, University of Bristol partnership

**Budget:**
- Signage & infrastructure: £5K
- Workshop development: £5K
- Coordinator (part-time, 6 months): £15K
- Evaluation: £5K

**Phase 3: Interconnection (Months 19-36, 2027-2029)**

**Third Intervention: CLT Housing**

**Leverage:** Bristol CLT exists but small—scale it

**The Pitch:**
"14,000 on housing waiting list. Council can't build fast enough. We propose CLT partnership:
- Identify council-owned land (unused, contaminated, awkward plots)
- Transfer to CLT at nominal value
- CLT develops affordable housing (permanently affordable—no extraction)
- Council gets credit, community gets homes, no sale-and-repeat cycle

Similar to Granby CLT (Liverpool) which won Turner Prize for urban regeneration."

**Budget:** Larger (£200K+), but combination of:
- Council land transfer (in-kind)
- National Housing Fund grants
- Social investment (Triodos, Charity Bank)
- Community shares

**Interconnection goal:**
By 2029, Bristol has:
- 3+ ecological sanctuaries (urban nature reserves)
- 10+ cognitive sovereignty zones (digital wellness)
- 1 CLT producing 20-50 units affordable housing
- Model documented for replication

**Bristol - Common Objections & Answers**

**Objection 1:** "We can't give up council control of parks"
**Answer:** "You're not giving up control—you're co-managing with community, which saves you £X in maintenance while improving outcomes. Council retains ownership, community manages day-to-day. Look at Avon Wildlife Trust—they manage sites on your behalf already."

**Objection 2:** "Community groups aren't capable of managing complex projects"
**Answer:** "Bristol Cable, Acorn, and Bristol CLT already manage complex operations. We'll provide training and support. Plus, Granby CLT in Liverpool proves communities can manage—won Turner Prize for urban regeneration. Why not Bristol?"

**Objection 3:** "This sounds expensive when we're cutting budgets"
**Answer:** "The ecological sanctuary saves you maintenance costs—community volunteers do the work. The cognitive sovereignty pilot costs £30K but addresses £millions in mental health service demand. CLT housing leverages land you already own. This is strategic investment, not expense."

**Bristol - Month 1 Checklist**
- [ ] Email Cabinet Member for Housing about CLT partnership (use language from Phase 3 pitch)
- [ ] Contact Bristol Cable about coverage of pilot proposals
- [ ] Join Acorn or Bristol CLT—attend next meeting
- [ ] Identify 3-5 potential Ring 1 members from your networks
- [ ] Draft one-page Ecological Sanctuary proposal for Eastville Park
- [ ] Join cross-city coordination call (first Monday of month, details at end of chapter)

### 2. READING ★★★
**Population:** 174,000
**Council:** Labour majority (2023)
**Why target:** Tech/office hub, progressive shift, manageable size, London commuter belt

#### Current Situation (2025)

**Political landscape:**
- Labour won majority 2023 (previously Conservative/Lib Dem)
- New progressive council looking for defining projects
- Tech sector growing (Microsoft, Oracle, ING offices)
- University of Reading (17,000 students)

**Existing infrastructure:**
- Reading Co-operative Society (one of UK's oldest, but not radical)
- Fair Trade Town status
- Multiple tech worker groups
- Active student unions

**Current crises:**
- Housing: London overspill, prices rising faster than wages
- High Street: Retail decline, empty units
- Mental health: Tech worker burnout, student stress
- Commuting: Exhausting London commutes

#### The Reading Playbook

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6, 2026)**

**Target Institution:** Reading Borough Council - Planning & Community Services

**Key Contacts (Future-Proof):**
- **Leader of the Council** (currently Cllr Jason Brock, Labour): leader@reading.gov.uk
- **Cabinet Member for Housing & Communities**: housing@reading.gov.uk
- **Cabinet Member for Culture & Wellbeing**: wellbeing@reading.gov.uk
- **Reading Co-operative Society**: community@reading.coop
- **University of Reading Students' Union**: su@reading.ac.uk

**First Intervention: Cognitive Sovereignty Pilot**

**Why start here:** Tech workers, students, commuters all experiencing digital burnout. High demand.

**Location:** Central Library, town center, university campus

**The Pitch:**
"Reading has 30,000+ tech workers and 17,000 students. Screen addiction is epidemic. We propose £40K pilot:
- 'Digital Sanctuary' spaces (libraries, community centers, partner cafes)
- 'Screen-Free Sundays' campaign
- Workshops: 'Reclaim Your Attention' (for workers, students, parents)
- Council policy: 'Right to Disconnect' (council employees pilot, then advocate for private sector)

Positions Reading as wellness leader, attracts talent ('work-life balance city'), builds movement."

**Budget:**
- Coordinator (part-time, 12 months): £20K
- Workshop development & delivery: £8K
- Marketing & signage: £5K
- Tech (app for tracking, community platform): £4K
- Evaluation: £3K

**Funding:**
- Council public health budget (£20K—link to mental health strategy)
- University partnership (£10K—student wellbeing)
- Crowdfunding (£10K)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-2: Council approval, space identification, partnerships
- Months 3-4: Sanctuary setup, marketing launch
- Months 5-6: Workshops running, media coverage

**Success metrics:**
- 3+ digital sanctuaries established
- 500+ people attending workshops
- Council 'Right to Disconnect' policy piloted
- Local business adoption (at least 2-3 companies)

**Phase 2: Expansion (Months 7-18, 2026-2027)**

**Second Intervention: High Street Cooperative Conversion**

**Leverage:** Empty retail units, tech worker income, cooperative society exists

**The Pitch:**
"High Street dying: 20%+ vacancy. We propose cooperative conversion:
- Identify 3-5 empty units
- Convert to co-ops: cafe, bookshop, workspace, repair shop
- Council facilitates: reduced business rates, planning support
- Tech workers become member-owners (they have income, want community)
- Reinvest profits locally

Similar to Preston model but scaled to Reading. Creates jobs, community wealth, High Street revival."

**Phase 3: Integration (Months 19-36, 2027-2029)**

**Third Intervention: Commuter Sanctuary**

**The gap:** Reading is London's bedroom—commuters exhausted, disconnected

**The Pitch:**
"50,000+ commute to London daily. They're Reading residents but barely experience Reading. We propose:
- 'Commuter Sanctuaries' at train station (screen-free zone, meditation, community board)
- 'Reading After Work' program (evening activities that aren't pub or home)
- 'Slow Commute' campaign (cycle routes, walking groups, car-sharing)

Goal: Transform Reading from 'place you sleep' to 'place you belong.'"

**Reading - Common Objections & Answers**

**Objection 1:** "Tech companies won't adopt 'Right to Disconnect'—they need staff available"
**Answer:** "France, Portugal, Belgium, and Ontario have legally mandated right to disconnect. Productivity *increased*—burned-out workers are less productive. Start with council pilot, then voluntary adoption by progressive companies. Microsoft, Oracle, ING—they're competing for talent. 'Wellness-friendly employer' is a recruitment advantage."

**Objection 2:** "Empty units are empty because businesses failed—why would co-ops succeed?"
**Answer:** "Businesses failed because they extracted profits for distant shareholders. Co-ops reinvest locally. Reading Co-op Society has survived 150+ years. Plus, we're targeting services tech workers want—repair shops, third spaces, ethical retail—not competing with Amazon."

**Objection 3:** "This is just middle-class wellness stuff, what about people struggling?"
**Answer:** "Digital addiction hits everyone—low-income families trapped on screens too. High Street co-ops create *jobs* (not just consumption). Commuter sanctuaries serve working-class commuters as much as tech workers. This isn't luxury—it's infrastructure."

**Reading - Month 1 Checklist**
- [ ] Email Leader of Council about Cognitive Sovereignty pilot (use Phase 1 pitch language)
- [ ] Contact Reading Co-operative Society about partnership
- [ ] Visit Central Library—speak to librarians about digital sanctuary idea
- [ ] Identify 5 potential Ring 1 members (tech workers, students, community organizers)
- [ ] Draft one-page proposal for Screen-Free Sundays campaign
- [ ] Join cross-city coordination call

### 3. LIVERPOOL ★★★
**Population:** 486,000
**Council:** Labour majority (historically strong)
**Why target:** Cooperative tradition, Granby CLT success, progressive culture, economic pressure

#### Current Situation (2025)

**Political landscape:**
- Labour stronghold (but progressive wing active)
- Granby Four Streets CLT exists (won Turner Prize 2015)
- Cooperative tradition (still strong in culture if not economy)
- Post-industrial: docks closed, regeneration ongoing

**Existing infrastructure:**
- Granby CLT (the model)
- Liverpool Mutual Homes (community-led housing)
- Multiple faith networks
- Strong union presence (especially docks, public sector)
- Universities: Liverpool, John Moores (combined 50,000 students)

**Current crises:**
- Housing: Regeneration displacing residents, affordability crisis
- Child poverty: 40%+ in some wards
- Health inequality: Life expectancy gap between rich/poor wards = 10 years
- Youth unemployment: High, especially in deprived areas

#### The Liverpool Playbook

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6, 2026)**

**Target Institution:** Liverpool City Council - Housing & Regeneration

**Key Contacts (Future-Proof):**
- **Cabinet Member for Housing**: housing@liverpool.gov.uk
- **Cabinet Member for Communities & Wellbeing**: communities@liverpool.gov.uk
- **Granby Four Streets CLT**: info@granby4streetsclt.co.uk
- **Liverpool Mutual Homes**: contact@liverpoolmutualhomes.org.uk
- **Homebaked CLT**: info@homebaked.org.uk

**First Intervention: CLT Scaling Pilot**

**Why start here:** Granby proved it works. Now scale it.

**The Pitch:**
"Granby Four Streets won Turner Prize for regeneration. It houses 30 families in permanently affordable homes. Liverpool has 10,000+ on housing waiting list. We propose scaling CLT model:
- Identify 3-5 sites (council-owned vacant land)
- Transfer to new CLTs (Granby model + support)
- Each CLT develops 10-20 units
- Council gets credit, communities get homes, no repeat sales extraction

Goal: 50-100 units by 2028. Granby shows it works—why isn't it citywide?"

**Budget (per CLT):**
- Legal setup: £5K
- Feasibility study: £10K
- Development costs: £150-200K (external funding—housing associations, grants)
- Community engagement: £5K

**Funding pathways:**
- Council land transfer (in-kind, biggest contribution)
- Homes England grants
- Social investment (Triodos, Co-op Bank)
- Housing association partnership

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Council approval, site identification, community consultation
- Months 4-6: Legal setup, feasibility studies, funding applications
- Months 6-18: Development begins (planning, building)
- Months 18-36: Occupancy, governance establishment

**Success metrics:**
- 3 new CLTs legally established
- Council approval for land transfers
- First developments underway by Year 2
- National media: "Liverpool scales CLT model"

**Phase 2: Interconnection (Months 7-18, 2026-2027)**

**Second Intervention: Faith-Based Sanctuaries**

**Leverage:** Strong faith networks (Catholic, Anglican, Muslim communities)

**The Pitch:**
"Liverpool has 300+ faith buildings. Many underused midweek. We propose 'Sacred Sanctuary' network:
- Faith spaces become community sanctuaries (open to all, regardless of belief)
- Digital detox zones, community meals, meditation/prayer (multi-faith)
- Mental health support (partnership with NHS)
- Youth programs (after-school, weekends)

Faith communities get purpose + funding. Community gets infrastructure. Council saves on youth services."

**Phase 3: Economic Base (Months 19-36, 2027-2029)**

**Third Intervention: Port City Cooperative Network**

**The gap:** Liverpool's cooperative heritage mostly gone (except retail co-op)

**The Pitch:**
"Liverpool was UK's cooperative capital. Let's rebuild that:
- Port-related co-ops (maritime services, green shipping, logistics)
- Tourism co-ops (hotels, guides, experiences—owned by workers)
- Creative co-ops (music, arts, cultural production—Liverpool brand)

Build on Liverpool's identity, create ownership culture, stop wealth extraction."

**Liverpool - Common Objections & Answers**

**Objection 1:** "We already have Granby CLT—why do more?"
**Answer:** "Because scaling success is how we change systems, not just neighborhoods. Granby proved the model works—now we apply it citywide. Why should only one neighborhood benefit? 10,000 on waiting list, and we have a solution that already won awards."

**Objection 2:** "CLT development is too expensive, we can't afford it"
**Answer:** "Council's contribution is land—you own vacant sites already. Homes England, housing associations, and social investors fund the building. Liverpool Mutual Homes operates at lower cost than council housing. The real question: can we afford NOT to solve the housing crisis?"

**Objection 3:** "Faith-based sanctuaries sound religious—we're a secular council"
**Answer:** "Sanctuaries are open to everyone regardless of belief. We're using existing infrastructure—churches, mosques, temples that are empty midweek. It's pragmatic, not religious. If faith communities want to help, why refuse?"

**Liverpool - Month 1 Checklist**
- [ ] Email Cabinet Member for Housing about CLT scaling (reference Granby in pitch)
- [ ] Visit Granby Four Streets CLT—speak to residents, learn model
- [ ] Contact Liverpool Mutual Homes about partnership
- [ ] Identify 3-5 potential Ring 1 members (housing campaigners, faith leaders, community organizers)
- [ ] Research vacant council-owned sites (use council property database)
- [ ] Draft one-page CLT scaling proposal

### 4. SHEFFIELD ★★
**Population:** 584,000
**Council:** Labour majority, Green presence
**Why target:** Green city brand, outdoor culture, cooperative history, universities

**Key Contacts (Future-Proof):**
- **Cabinet Member for Housing & Regeneration**: housing@sheffield.gov.uk
- **Cabinet Member for Environment & Sustainability**: environment@sheffield.gov.uk
- **Sheffield City Council Climate Team**: climate@sheffield.gov.uk
- **Sheffield Renewables** (community energy co-op): info@sheffieldrenewables.org.uk
- **Union of Students (University of Sheffield + Hallam)**: contact@shef.ac.uk

**First Intervention:** Sanctuary Network (leveraging green space abundance)

**Sheffield - Common Objections & Answers**

**Objection 1:** "We already manage parks well—why change?"
**Answer:** "You do, but budgets are cut yearly. Community co-management saves money while improving outcomes. Friends of groups exist—we're formalizing and expanding that. Peak District on doorstep—Sheffield should be UK sanctuary capital."

**Objection 2:** "Outdoor city brand already exists—what's new here?"
**Answer:** "Brand exists, infrastructure doesn't. We're building actual governance—sanctuary land trusts, community stewardship, legal protection. Marketing vs. reality. Let's make the brand true."

**Objection 3:** "This seems middle-class—what about deprived estates?"
**Answer:** "Deprived estates have worst access to green space. We prioritize sanctuary creation in Manor, Burngreave, Darnall—exactly where health inequality is highest. Green access is social justice."

**Sheffield - Month 1 Checklist**
- [ ] Email Cabinet Member for Environment about Sanctuary Network proposal
- [ ] Contact Sheffield Renewables about partnership/learning
- [ ] Visit Manor or Burngreave—speak to residents about green space needs
- [ ] Identify 5 potential Ring 1 members (environmental groups, estate residents, students)
- [ ] Draft one-page proposal for first sanctuary site
- [ ] Join cross-city coordination call

## What If My City Isn't Listed?

**If your city isn't in the ten, don't worry—these are templates, not an exclusive club.**

### Step 1: Identify Your City's Archetype

Look at the five archetypes table earlier in this chapter. Which one matches your city?

- **University/tech hub?** → Green/Tech Incubator (Bristol, Reading model)
- **Post-industrial city?** → Post-Industrial Fortress (Liverpool, Sheffield, Bradford)
- **Devolved powers?** → Devolved Powerhouse (Glasgow, Cardiff)
- **Mid-size (100-200K)?** → Mid-Size Innovator (Preston, Dundee)
- **Regional capital?** → Regional Hub (Newcastle, Glasgow, Sheffield)

### Step 2: Use That Archetype's Playbook as Template

Once you've identified your archetype:
- Same intervention sequence (Phase 1 → 2 → 3)
- Same pitch structure
- Same budget ranges
- Different names, same strategy

### Step 3: Adapt to Your Local Context

**Research your councillors:**
- Who's progressive? (Check voting records, public statements)
- Who's looking for innovative solutions?
- Who's frustrated with current system?

**Identify your local organizations:**
- Cooperatives, housing groups, unions, faith networks
- What's already working that you can accelerate?
- What's missing that you need to build?

**Find your crises:**
- Housing? Mental health? Economy?
- Youth services? High Street decline?
- What's acute enough that council will try new approaches?

**Translate playbook to your city's language:**
- Use local examples, not Bristol/Liverpool references
- Frame interventions using local crises and opportunities
- Adapt budgets to your scale

### Examples of Adaptation:

**Manchester** (not listed):
- **Archetype:** Post-Industrial Fortress + Regional Hub
- **Use:** Liverpool playbook (CLT scaling) + Sheffield playbook (sanctuary network)
- **Adaptation:** Manchester has cooperative history, large universities, housing crisis—same intervention sequence applies
- **Local angle:** "Manchester invented cooperative movement—let's reclaim that heritage"

**Brighton** (not listed):
- **Archetype:** Green/Tech Incubator
- **Use:** Bristol playbook
- **Adaptation:** Brighton already progressive, Green-controlled council, housing crisis acute
- **Local angle:** "Brighton talks progressive—let's build infrastructure that proves it"

**Edinburgh** (not listed):
- **Archetype:** Devolved Powerhouse
- **Use:** Glasgow playbook (Scottish Land Fund access)
- **Adaptation:** Edinburgh has resources Glasgow doesn't, can move faster
- **Local angle:** "Edinburgh leads Scotland on innovation—housing, sanctuaries, cooperatives"

**Birmingham** (not listed):
- **Archetype:** Regional Hub + Post-Industrial
- **Use:** Sheffield playbook
- **Adaptation:** Largest city outside London, massive diversity, huge challenges but huge potential
- **Local angle:** "Birmingham too big to fail—pilot here proves national scalability"

### The Principle

If Manchester organizers say "this book doesn't apply to us," they've missed the point.

**The playbooks are architecture, not blueprints.**

Same foundation (sanctuary governance, cognitive sovereignty, community wealth building).
Same intervention logic (Phase 1 foundation → Phase 2 expansion → Phase 3 integration).
Same budget tiers (see next section).

Different facades (your councillors, your organizations, your local crises).

### Contact the Network

Once you start, you're not alone:
- Join cross-city coordination calls (monthly, first Monday)
- Share documents, strategies, failures
- Learn from cities ahead of you, share with cities behind you
- Annual gatherings (2027 onwards)

**These 10 cities aren't competing—they're cooperating.**

Your city's success makes the next city's case stronger.
Failed experiments in one city save others from repeating mistakes.
Legal templates developed in Bristol work in Manchester with minimal changes.

**You're not just fighting for your city. You're building a node in a planetary network.**

## The Resource Requirements Simplified

Instead of detailed year-by-year budgets, here's what you actually need to know:

### Resource Tiers for Any Pilot

Match your ambition to your resources. £5K seed project is better than £500K dream that never launches.

| Tier | Budget | What It Gets You | Timeline | Funding Sources |
|------|---------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Seed** | £5K-20K | Community engagement, legal setup, initial planning, feasibility studies | Months 1-6 | Crowdfunding, small grants (£500-5K range), council community budgets, member donations |
| **Pilot** | £20K-100K | First physical/digital intervention, part-time coordinator, documented evaluation | Months 6-18 | National Lottery Community Fund, local foundations (Esmée Fairbairn, Tudor Trust), progressive individual donors, council partnership funding |
| **Scale** | £100K-500K | Multiple interventions, 2-3 full-time staff, professional evaluation, media capacity | Months 18-36 | Major foundations, central government pilots, social investment (Triodos, Big Issue Invest), earned revenue from consultancy/training |
| **Systemic** | £500K-2M | Citywide programs, permanent infrastructure, replication support, policy influence | Years 3-5 | Government policy funding (once proven), large-scale social investment, community shares, earned revenue becomes significant |

### Examples by Tier

**Seed tier (£5K-20K):**
- Bristol Ecological Sanctuary: Community consultation, legal setup, initial planting
- Reading Screen-Free Sundays: Marketing campaign, 3-month trial, evaluation
- Liverpool Faith Sanctuary: One pilot site, 6-month trial
- **Get this from:** Crowdfunder campaign + council community grant

**Pilot tier (£20K-100K):**
- Bristol Cognitive Sovereignty: 12-month coordinator, 3 sanctuary spaces, workshops
- Reading High Street Co-op: One shop conversion, legal setup, first-year operation
- Liverpool CLT: One site development (council land + external funding for building)
- **Get this from:** National Lottery (£10-50K grants common) + foundation + council

**Scale tier (£100K-500K):**
- Bristol full stack: 3 sanctuaries + cognitive sovereignty + CLT housing
- Sheffield Sanctuary Network: 5+ sites, professional coordination, national model
- Glasgow citywide: Multiple interventions, Scottish government partnership
- **Get this from:** Central government pilots + major foundations + social investment

**Systemic tier (£500K-2M):**
- Any city becoming national model
- Training other cities, policy influence, permanent infrastructure
- This tier comes AFTER you've proven the model—funders invest in success
- **Get this from:** Mix of all above + earned revenue (other cities pay for training/consultancy)

### The Principle

**You don't need £2M to start. You need £5K and strategic thinking.**

Start at seed tier:
- Prove concept with minimal resources
- Document everything
- Show results (even small ones)
- Use success to unlock next tier

**Each tier unlocks the next:**
- Seed success → funders take you seriously → pilot funding
- Pilot success → media attention, council commitment → scale funding
- Scale success → government notices → systemic funding

**Real example:**
- Granby CLT started with £1.5M? No.
- Started with residents, architects, sweat equity
- Small grants (£10-20K) for planning
- Proved concept
- Then larger funding came
- Now: National model, Turner Prize, studied worldwide

**Your city can follow same path.**

## Timeline: The Five-Year Transformation (2026-2030)

### 2026: Launch Year

**Q1 (Jan-Mar):**
- Organizers in each city identify councillors, make contact
- Ring 1 recruitment (5-10 committed people per city)
- Crowdfunding campaigns begin
- Legal groundwork (setup entities where needed)

**Q2 (Apr-Jun):**
- First proposals submitted to councils
- Funding applications sent (National Lottery, foundations)
- Community engagement begins (consultations, events)
- Some pilots approved and launching

**Q3 (Jul-Sep):**
- Early pilots implementing (Bristol sanctuary planting, Reading workshops, Liverpool CLT sites)
- Documentation of learnings (what's working, what's not)
- Media coverage beginning (local press, community media)
- Adjustments based on early feedback

**Q4 (Oct-Dec):**
- Year-end review (10-city coordination call)
- Successes celebrated, failures analyzed
- Year 2 planning (expand successful pilots, pivot failing ones)
- Recruitment of Ring 2 (growing squads from 5-10 to 15-30)

### 2027: Consolidation Year

**Q1-Q2:**
- Successful pilots → Phase 2 interventions
- Bristol: Sanctuary working → add Cognitive Sovereignty
- Liverpool: First CLT built → start second and third
- Reading: Workshops popular → add High Street co-op

**Q3-Q4:**
- New cities joining (beyond initial 10—Manchester, Brighton, Birmingham adapting playbooks)
- First evaluation reports published (professional, academic)
- Academic interest: Research partnerships, student projects
- Media attention scaling ("A New Movement Emerges: UK Cities Experiment with Sanctuary Governance")

### 2028: Scaling Year

**Q1-Q2:**
- Multiple interventions per city (not just one pilot—stacking)
- Bristol has: 3 sanctuaries + cognitive zones + CLT
- 20+ cities now involved (initial 10 + 10 new)
- First international visitors (European cities learning from UK)
- Conferences: "Community Wealth Building 2.0" with sanctuary/sovereignty focus

**Q3-Q4:**
- Major evaluation: "Does This Work?" (commissioned by foundation or government)
- Policy papers: "How to Do This" (practitioner guides)
- Political manifestos: Labour, Green, Plaid including these ideas
- Pressure on national government: "Why isn't this everywhere?"

### 2029: Breakthrough Year

**Q1-Q2:**
- National policy pilots (central government commits funding to test in 5-10 more cities)
- Or: Opposition parties commit "If elected, we'll roll this out"
- Blueprint finalized: "Any City Can Do This" manual
- Training programs: Organizers from new cities learning from pilot cities

**Q3-Q4:**
- Systemic shift occurring ("This is how cities work now")
- Media narrative: "The Sanctuary Movement Transforms Britain"
- This is now mainstream, not radical
- Local government association endorses model
- Victory: New normal established

### 2030: Consolidation & Expansion

- Majority of UK cities have some version (50+)
- National policies in place (funding streams, legal frameworks)
- International replication beginning (Europe, North America, Global South adaptations)
- **Mission accomplished: Systemic alternative operational**

### What This Timeline Assumes

**Optimistic but realistic:**
- Assumes 70% of pilots succeed (30% fail—that's expected)
- Assumes progressive councils stay progressive (some will flip—adapt)
- Assumes funding comes through (tier by tier, as proven)
- Assumes no major disruptions (economic crisis, political backlash—Chapter 18 covers defense)

**Not guaranteed, but achievable:**
- If organizers execute competently
- If councils partner rather than obstruct
- If early successes are documented and shared
- If movement stays focused on replication, not perfection

## The Cross-City Coordination Strategy

### Monthly Coordination Calls (First Monday, 7pm UK time)

**Agenda structure:**
1. **Wins (15 min):** Each city shares one success from past month
2. **Challenges (15 min):** Each city shares one major obstacle
3. **Support requests (15 min):** "We need help with X—who can assist?"
4. **Strategic decisions (15 min):** Movement-wide choices (media strategy, funding applications, policy advocacy)

**Why this works:**
- Prevents isolation (you're part of something bigger)
- Rapid learning (Liverpool's mistake prevents Bristol repeating it)
- Resource sharing (Bristol's legal template saves Reading £5K in fees)
- Morale building (hearing other cities' wins keeps you going)

### Shared Resources Platform

**What gets shared:**
- Legal templates (land trust setup, co-op articles, lease agreements)
- Pitch documents (councillor pitches, funding applications, community presentations)
- Evaluation frameworks (what to measure, how to measure, reporting templates)
- Media resources (press releases, social media, interview prep)

**How it works:**
- Online platform (Google Drive or better: Nextcloud for data sovereignty)
- Each city uploads documents (with permission to adapt/reuse)
- Templates version-controlled (Bristol v1.0 → Bristol v2.0 after learning)
- New cities: Don't start from scratch, use existing templates

### Annual Gatherings (Starting 2027)

**Structure:**
- 2-day event (weekend)
- Hosted by different city each year (2027: Bristol, 2028: Liverpool, 2029: Glasgow, etc.)
- Mix of:
  - Strategy sessions (where's the movement going?)
  - Skill-building (workshops on organizing, legal, media)
  - Celebration (we're winning, let's acknowledge that)
  - Networking (Ring 1 meeting Ring 1 from other cities—relationships matter)

**Why in-person matters:**
- Trust building (you work harder for people you've met)
- Tacit knowledge transfer (some things can't be written, only shown)
- Movement culture (shared identity, songs, stories)
- Strategic coherence (hard to coordinate 10 cities remotely without occasional face-to-face)

### Media Coordination

**The problem:** 10 cities all doing media separately = fragmented message

**The solution:** Coordinated narrative

**Structure:**
- Shared media contact list (journalists interested in this work)
- Message calendar (Bristol announces sanctuary success Monday, Liverpool announces CLT opening Thursday—sequenced, not simultaneous)
- Amplification protocol (when one city gets national coverage, others amplify on social media)
- Crisis response (if one city attacked, others defend publicly—"This worked in Liverpool, why oppose it in Bristol?")

**Example:**
- February 2027: Bristol sanctuary evaluation published (positive results)
- Bristol organizers: Press release to Guardian, local media
- Sheffield organizers: Twitter thread "Bristol proves sanctuary model works—Sheffield next"
- Reading organizers: Letter to local paper "If Bristol can, why can't Reading?"
- Result: National narrative "Sanctuary movement spreading" instead of "Bristol does weird thing"

### Financial Coordination

**The gap:** Funders don't want to fund 10 identical pilots—looks like duplication

**The solution:** Portfolio strategy

**Structure:**
- Cities are NOT competing for same funding
- Bristol targets X foundations, Liverpool targets Y foundations
- When funder says "We already funded Bristol," response is "Exactly—now fund Liverpool to prove it's replicable, not a one-off"
- Shared funding intelligence ("Foundation Z is interested in sanctuaries, Foundation A wants economic justice, Foundation B does both—coordinate applications")

**Mutual support:**
- Bristol's success becomes Liverpool's case ("It worked there, replicate here")
- Liverpool's failure becomes Manchester's learning ("They tried X, didn't work, we'll try Y instead—cheaper for you")
- Evaluation shared across cities (one £50K evaluation covers all 10, not 10 separate evaluations)

## What Chapter 18 Delivers

You now have targeting package:
- Ten specific cities with exact playbooks
- Future-proof contacts (roles persist, people change)
- Common objections with proven answers
- Month 1 checklists (what to do immediately)
- Simplified resource tiers (match ambition to reality)
- "What if my city isn't listed?" guidance
- Timeline for transformation (2026-2030)
- Cross-city coordination strategy

**Chapter 18 is about defense:**
- When oligarchy pushes back (they will)
- Legal attacks (how to defend)
- Media campaigns (how to respond)
- Funding cuts (how to survive)
- Infiltration attempts (how to detect and counter)

**The connection:**
- Chapter 15: How to infiltrate institutions
- Chapter 16: How to build organized people
- Chapter 17: Where to deploy both (specific cities, real playbooks)
- Chapter 18: How to defend when they attack (because they will)
- Together: Full campaign from strategy through defense

## Reality Check: The Pilot City Readiness Test

**Question 1:** Are you in or near one of these ten cities?

- **If yes:** Use the playbook for your city (future-proof contacts, common objections, Month 1 checklist)
- **If no:** Identify your archetype, adapt the playbook (see "What If My City Isn't Listed?")

**Question 2:** Can you reach out to at least 2 councillors or organizations this week?

- **If no:** Do more research. Find who's actually progressive in your area. This chapter provides template—adapt to your context.

**Question 3:** Do you have £5K+ pathway identified for seed tier?

- **If no:** Start smaller. The playbooks are ideals. Adapt to your resources. £1K crowdfunder + sweat equity is better than £100K dream.

**If yes to all three:** You're ready to launch. Use Month 1 checklist.

**If no to any:** Work on capacity first, but don't wait for perfect conditions. Start now with what you have.

## The Constellation Strategy

These ten cities aren't isolated islands. They're **beachheads**.

When Bristol proves sanctuary governance works, Sheffield can point to Bristol's evaluation.
When Glasgow uses Scottish Land Fund, Liverpool organizers can demand "Why don't we have this in England?"
When Preston adds cognitive sovereignty, Newcastle can say "If Preston can, why can't we?"

**This is the network effect:**
- Your city's success makes the next city's case stronger
- Failed experiments in one city save others from repeating mistakes
- Legal templates developed in Bristol work in Reading with minimal changes
- Councillors talk to each other—your councillor seeing another city's success matters

**You're not just fighting for your city. You're building a node in a planetary network.**

By 2030, the vision is:
- 10 cities with proven models becomes 50
- 50 becomes 200
- 200 becomes "this is just how cities work now"
- The alternative becomes the mainstream

**Start where you are.**
Bristol or Bradford, Brighton or Birmingham, your city or the next one over.

**Connect with the rest.**
Monthly calls, shared documents, annual gatherings. You're not alone.

**Change one city, change the system.**
Because once it works in ten places, it's not radical anymore. It's proven. It's replicable. It's inevitable.

**The oligarchy can stop one city. They can't stop a constellation.**

**Next: Chapter 18 - When They Push Back**

*Legal, financial, media, and regulatory counter-moves. How to defend your pilots when oligarchy attacks.*

(Because they will attack. Every successful pilot threatens their power. This chapter prepares you for their counter-moves and teaches you how to survive them.)
