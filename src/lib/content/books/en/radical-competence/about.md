**ABOUT THE AUTHOR**

**Björn Kenneth Holmström** is a systems thinker and the architect of the initial phase of the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)**. His mission is to contribute to the redesign of civilization, moving beyond critique to build the operating systems that make human flourishing structurally possible.

His background is not in traditional politics, but in **Engineering Physics** and **Mathematical Optimization**. He approaches the polycrisis less like a politician seeking votes and more like an engineer debugging a complex system. He looks for the "source code" of our civilization—the incentive structures, feedback loops, and cognitive architectures that drive our collective behavior.

Björn is the founder of [**Spiralize.org**](https://www.spiralize.org), a platform for developmental psychology, and the initiator of **Fjärilspartiet (The Butterfly Party)** in Sweden, a political prototype designed to test systemic governance principles in the real world.

Drawing from a life lived across extremes—from foraging in the Basque Country to architecting planetary-scale systems—he bridges the gap between theoretical rigor and lived wisdom.

In the digital realm, he is known to some as **Pwnytale**, a strategist who applies the same pattern recognition used in competitive gaming to the infinite game of civilizational design.

He writes, builds, and thinks from **Stockholm, Sweden**.
