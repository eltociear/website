# Appendix D: Integration Scorecard Template

*Before You Launch That Campaign: The Six-Domain Reality Check*

---

## Why This Matters

You've been to the planning meetings. Someone proposes a new campaign, project, or intervention. Everyone gets excited. Energy builds. You launch.

Three months later, it's either:
- Collapsed under its own weight
- Succeeded in one area while creating problems in others
- Running on fumes from the same 5 exhausted organizers
- Producing outcomes nobody actually wanted

**This happens because most organizing interventions are designed in a single domain without checking for integration failures.**

The Integration Scorecard prevents that. Use it before launching anything significant. Use it to diagnose why existing work isn't landing. Use it to explain to funders why your "less exciting" but more integrated approach will actually succeed.

**This isn't busywork. This is the difference between effective organizing and activist performance art.**

---

## How to Use This Tool

**For New Interventions (Before Launch):**
1. Fill out the scorecard for your proposed intervention
2. Identify which domains are addressed and which are ignored
3. Check for integration failures (Section 3)
4. Redesign intervention to address gaps
5. Run it again to verify improvements

**For Existing Work (Diagnosis):**
1. Fill out scorecard for current campaign/project
2. Compare intended vs. actual domain impacts
3. Identify where things are failing
4. Adjust intervention based on findings
5. Reassess in 90 days

**For Strategic Planning:**
1. Score your organization's overall work across domains
2. Identify systematic blind spots
3. Adjust strategy to build integration capacity
4. Track organizational development over time

**Average Score:** ________ (Add all scores, divide by 6)

**Highest Scoring Domain:** ________________ (This is your strength - leverage it)

**Lowest Scoring Domain:** ________________ (This is your integration failure point)

**Score Range:** ________ (Highest - Lowest)

---

### Interpretation Guide

**Average Score:**
- **4.0-5.0:** Strong integration - intervention works across multiple domains
- **3.0-3.9:** Moderate integration - some domains addressed, others neglected
- **2.0-2.9:** Weak integration - likely to fail or create new problems
- **Below 2.0:** Integration crisis - don't launch this; redesign from scratch

**Score Range:**
- **0-1:** Well-integrated across domains
- **2-3:** Significant imbalance - strong in some areas, weak in others
- **4+:** Severe fragmentation - success in one domain will likely come at cost of others

---

### Common Integration Failure Patterns

Check if your intervention matches any of these common failure modes:

#### **The Activist Performance Pattern**
- High: Spiritual/Existential (feels meaningful!), Social (we're together!)
- Low: Biological (burnout), Cognitive (no strategy), Behavioral (no skills built)
- **Diagnosis:** All passion, no logistics. Feels good, accomplishes little, exhausts people.
- **Fix:** Add concrete skill-building, strategic planning, and sustainability planning.

#### **The Think Tank Pattern**
- High: Cognitive (great analysis!), Spiritual/Existential (important issue!)
- Low: Behavioral (no action), Social (isolated), Biological (precarious)
- **Diagnosis:** Smart people writing papers nobody reads while urgent problems persist.
- **Fix:** Add implementation pathways, coalition building, and material support.

#### **The Single-Issue Hammer Pattern**
- High: One domain only (e.g., Behavioral - "do this action!")
- Low: All other domains
- **Diagnosis:** Narrow intervention ignoring systemic interconnections. Creates whack-a-mole dynamics.
- **Fix:** Map how your issue connects to other domains; design holistic intervention.

#### **The Hero Organizer Pattern**
- High: All domains... but dependent on one person
- **Diagnosis:** Works while hero is present; collapses when they burn out or leave.
- **Fix:** Distribute capacities, build infrastructure that doesn't depend on individuals.

#### **The Extractive Solidarity Pattern**
- High: Spiritual/Existential (solidarity!), Social (we're united!)
- Low: Biological (demands sacrifice), Emotional (guilt-based), Behavioral (unsustainable)
- **Diagnosis:** Asks people to sacrifice their wellbeing "for the cause." Creates resentment and burnout.
- **Fix:** Build mutual aid into the work; ensure campaign improves participants' lives.

**Does your intervention match any of these patterns?** ☐ Yes  ☐ No

**If yes, which one:** _________________________________________________

---

## Section 3: Integration Failure Diagnostic

### Cross-Domain Conflicts

**Are any domains actively working against each other?**

Examples:
- Cognitive strategy requires 40 hours/week but Biological reality is people have jobs
- Emotional culture is "stay positive" but Spiritual purpose is addressing grief and loss
- Social structure is hierarchical but Behavioral goal is building agency and autonomy

## Section 6: Implementation Planning

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

**Focus:** Build infrastructure in weakest domains before launch

**Key activities:**
1. _____________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________

**Success metrics:**
_______________________________________________________________________

---

### Phase 2: Pilot (Months 3-6)

**Focus:** Test intervention at small scale, monitor integration

**Key activities:**
1. _____________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________

**Integration checkpoints:** (How will you know if domains are staying in balance?)
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

---

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Iteration (Months 6-9)

**Focus:** Assess actual vs. intended domain impacts, adjust

**Key questions:**
- Which domains performed as expected?
- Which showed unexpected problems or benefits?
- What integration failures emerged that weren't predicted?
- How did participants experience the intervention across domains?

**Data collection methods:**
_______________________________________________________________________

---

### Phase 4: Scale or Pivot (Months 9-12)

**Decision criteria:**
☐ Average score ≥3.5 across all domains → Scale
☐ Average score 2.5-3.4 → Iterate and test again
☐ Average score `<`2.5 → Major redesign or abandon

**If scaling, what changes needed to maintain integration?**
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

---

## Section 7: Synergy & Redundancy Analysis

### Synergy Opportunities

**Where do domains reinforce each other positively?**

Examples:
- "Our community meals (Biological) also build relationships (Social) and create space for strategy discussions (Cognitive)"
- "Skill-building workshops (Behavioral) increase confidence (Emotional) and develop leaders (Social)"

**Identified synergies in your intervention:**
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

**How can you amplify these?**
_______________________________________________________________________

---

### Redundancy Assessment

**Are you duplicating existing work unnecessarily?**

**Other organizations/campaigns doing similar work:**
1. ____________________________________________________________________
2. ____________________________________________________________________
3. ____________________________________________________________________

**For each, answer:**
- Could you collaborate instead of competing? ☐ Yes  ☐ No  ☐ Maybe
- Do they have strengths in domains where you're weak? ☐ Yes  ☐ No
- Could you specialize rather than duplicate? ☐ Yes  ☐ No

**If there's significant overlap:**
☐ Proceed anyway (justification: ___________________________________)
☐ Merge or partner with existing work
☐ Pivot to fill different niche
☐ Focus on different domains than existing work addresses

---

## Section 8: Decision Point

Based on this complete analysis:

**Should this intervention proceed?**
☐ YES - Strong integration, ready to launch
☐ YES WITH MODIFICATIONS - Specific changes needed (listed below)
☐ MAYBE - Needs more design work before decision
☐ NO - Integration failures too severe, abandon or completely redesign

**If proceeding, what are the non-negotiable requirements for maintaining integration?**

1. _____________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________

**Who is responsible for monitoring integration during implementation?**
_______________________________________________________________________

**What's the trigger for stopping if integration fails?**
_______________________________________________________________________

---

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Red Flags (Stop and Redesign)

- **Average score `<`2.5** - Integration too weak to succeed
- **Any domain scored 1** - Active harm being done
- **Range `>`3** - Success in one area will create failure in others
- **Unpaid labor from precarious people** - Exploitative and unsustainable
- **"We'll figure it out as we go"** - No, you won't
- **Dependent on hero organizers** - Will collapse when they burn out
- **"Just trust the process"** - Process needs integration analysis too

### Green Lights (Proceed with Confidence)

- **Average score ≥4.0** - Strong integration across domains
- **Range `<`1.5** - Well-balanced intervention
- **Clear sustainability plan** - Not dependent on unsustainable inputs
- **Addresses lowest-scoring domain** - Acknowledges weakness, has plan
- **Synergies identified and amplified** - Domains reinforce each other
- **Realistic about scale** - Designed for actual capacity, not fantasy
- **Participants' lives improve** - Win or lose, people are better off

---

## Using This with Groups

**For Strategy Meetings:**
1. Each person scores the proposed intervention independently
2. Share scores and discuss discrepancies
3. Identify integration failures as a group
4. Redesign together based on analysis
5. Re-score to verify improvements

**For Funder Conversations:**
- Use this to explain why your "slower" approach will actually succeed
- Show you've thought through integration that others ignore
- Demonstrate strategic sophistication
- Provide clear metrics for success

**For Post-Campaign Analysis:**
- Score both intended and actual impacts
- Identify where predictions were wrong
- Document lessons for next intervention
- Share insights with broader movement

---

## Final Reminder

**This tool exists because most organizing fails not from lack of passion, but from lack of integration.**

You're trying to build alternative systems inside a system designed to prevent exactly that. You need:
- **Rigor** to see the patterns
- **Honesty** to acknowledge the failures
- **Courage** to redesign when something's not working
- **Patience** to build infrastructure before launching campaigns

**Use this scorecard. Actually use it.**

Not because it's fun (it's not), but because it's the difference between effective organizing that builds power and activist theater that exhausts people while changing nothing.

Your movement can't afford the latter. The world definitely can't.
