## Introduction: The Other Half of Care

In our last post, we introduced 'Hearts'—a visionary idea to recognize and reward the essential work of caring for each other. But caring for people is only half the equation. Our planet, the foundation of all life, is crying out for care, yet our economy assigns no value to a forest left standing or a river restored. What if we could change that? We propose **'Leaves'** 🍃, a currency designed to honor and incentivize the vital work of planetary stewardship.

To be clear, this isn’t a finished product—it’s a **thought experiment** we’re inviting you to help shape. How could a currency for planetary care work? Let’s explore the possibilities step by step.

| Feature | **Traditional Dollars** | **Regenerative 'Leaves'** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Incentivize Consumption & Extraction | Incentivize Stewardship & Regeneration |
| **Value Is...** | Scarce & Competitive | Abundant & Collaborative |
| **Core Question** | How much can we take? | How much can we heal? |

## What Are 'Leaves'? A Vision for an Economy of Stewardship

We envision that **Leaves would be a digital token earned by individuals and communities for verified actions that heal and regenerate our natural world.**

The core philosophy is simple: Leaves are a way to honor the human labor of stewardship—caring for ecosystems the way 'Hearts' cares for people. It’s about building an economy in **Right Relationship** with the Earth, rewarding the work that sustains all life.

The value of a Leaf wouldn’t be arbitrary or set by speculative markets. It would be calibrated by communities based on the effort, skill, and ecological impact of the work, ensuring fair rewards for the stewards who perform it. Crucially, this system would prioritize those who have long been the planet’s caretakers, like Indigenous communities and other marginalized groups, creating pathways for their deep ecological knowledge to be properly valued and rewarded.

To prevent "gaming the system" by rewarding shallow fixes, the issuance of Leaves would be guided by a **holistic well-being index**, co-designed with Indigenous stewards and ecologists. This ensures we are incentivizing the deep, patient work of regeneration—like restoring biodiversity—over simplistic metrics like planting a monoculture forest.

## How It Could Work: A Step-by-Step Vision

This system is designed to be simple in practice, even if the ideas behind it are profound. We envision a clear, three-step process:

* **1. The Regenerative Act:** Imagine a person or a community group undertaking a project—like reforesting a hillside in Brazil or creating an urban community garden in Nairobi.
* **2. The Verification:** The work would then be verified by a local, trusted, community-led body. To make this concrete, we propose a **"Trust but Verify"** approach. For a small garden, a trained **"Community Weaver"** could use geotagged photos and a community-signed checklist. For larger projects like reforestation, verification might combine local reports with public satellite data to confirm the long-term impact, ensuring the claims are credible.
* **3. The Reward:** Once verified, the contribution would generate **Leaves** in the participants’ digital wallets. Each Leaf would act as a unique digital certificate—much like an NFT—serving as a permanent and transparent record of the ecological work that was completed.

#### The Support System: Keeping It Fair and Accessible

To ensure this system works for everyone, we envision a simple, supportive structure. Trained **"Community Weavers"** would act as on-the-ground guides to help people get started. A **global non-profit** would provide open-source tools and standards to ensure quality, and an **independent arbitration service** would be available to resolve any disputes. This isn’t about creating a new bureaucracy—it’s about providing the light-touch support needed to enable trust and fairness.

## Getting Started: Imagining Your First Leaf

So, how could you earn your first Leaf? We propose a practical pathway that begins with connection. You would start by connecting with your local **Community Weaver**, who would be accessible via an open-source app or website. Recognizing the digital divide, this service would be planned for 10 languages and include paper guides for offline access. The Weaver would help you design a project, like planting native species in your backyard or joining a wetland restoration. Once your project is verified, Leaves would appear in your wallet, ready to be converted to Hearts for use in your community.

It is important to state that this is a **research hypothesis**, not a launched program. We are currently developing this model through rigorous design and are actively seeking partners to co-create pilot tests. Over the next **5-10 years**, we aim to refine Leaves into a scalable system, building on the lessons learned from pioneering models like the Bristol Pound local currency.

## The Regenerative Loop: A Vision for Planet and Community

![Leaves Currency Flow Diagram](/images/blog/introducing-leaves/leaves-currency-flow-diagram.svg)

We envision **'Leaves'** converting into **'Hearts'** through a transparent, community-driven process we call the 'Value Exchange'.

This creates a powerful feedback loop. Imagine a youth group restoring a local riverbank, earning **Leaves** for their work. They could then convert those **Leaves** into **Hearts** and use them for a community feast at a local cafe that is part of the network. In this hypothetical example, the loop is complete: **ecological healing is directly transformed into community well-being.**

## The Bridge to the Real World: Connecting to the Economy

**'Leaves'** and **'Hearts'** wouldn’t be 'play money'—they would be designed to connect to the real-world economy.

#### A Hypothetical Walk-Through

Here’s how it could work:

1.  Maria’s youth group earns **50 Leaves** for a verified riverbank restoration.
2.  Through a proposed 'Value Exchange' app, they see these 50 Leaves are worth approximately **$30 in purchasing power**, based on a stable rate set by a local Community Treasury.
3.  They convert the Leaves to **30 Hearts**.
4.  They use the 30 Hearts at Fatima’s Cafe, a local business that would accept Hearts. Fatima could then redeem the 30 Hearts for **$30** from the treasury, ensuring real, dependable value.

#### The Engine Under the Hood

How would this stay stable? We propose a **Community Treasury** using reserve funds, dynamic issuance rates, and a community-calibrated value system (guided by the holistic well-being index) to prevent inflation and ensure reliability. These mechanics are being refined through research and will require collaboration to perfect.

Of course. Here are the next two sections of the blog post, "Safeguards" and "Technology with Intention," drafted directly from the final outline.

## Safeguards: Designing Trust into the System

To make a visionary idea like **'Leaves'** trustworthy, we propose building it with **robust safeguards** from the very beginning. We envision a system where **randomized audits** by independent verifiers would help catch fake projects. **Community oversight boards** would ensure that the on-the-ground 'Community Weavers' remain accountable to the people they serve. For any disputes, an **independent arbitration service** would be available to address manipulation concerns fairly and transparently. These are the kinds of ideas being developed to ensure trust is designed into the system at every step.

## Technology with Intention: Ensuring Access and Sustainability

We envision digital tools that are built on **energy-efficient blockchain technology** to consciously avoid the massive carbon footprint associated with speculative cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, recognizing that not everyone has access to the latest smartphone, we propose that the system must be inclusive from the start. Our early designs therefore include **simplified web forms, SMS updates, and even paper-based guides** to ensure that everyone who wants to participate, can.

Of course. Here are the final two sections of the blog post, "What Kind of Work Could Earn 'Leaves'?" and the Conclusion, drafted from the final outline.

## What Kind of Work Could Earn 'Leaves'?

We propose a list of inspiring projects to make the concept more tangible. Here are just a few examples of the kinds of stewardship that could be rewarded with **'Leaves'**:

* **Reforestation:** Planting and stewarding 100 native trees in a degraded watershed.
* **Regenerative Agriculture:** A farmer transitioning 50 acres to no-till practices that verifiably sequester carbon in the soil.
* **Coastal Restoration:** A community group restoring a vital mangrove forest that protects against storm surges and nurtures biodiversity.
* **Urban Greening:** A neighborhood collective creating a pollinator garden and green space on a previously abandoned city lot.

## Conclusion: An Invitation to Co-Design an Economy for Life

**'Hearts'** and **'Leaves'** are a proposed dual-currency system with a single purpose: to build an economy that values life. 'Hearts' would channel our resources toward caring for each other; 'Leaves' would reward caring for our shared home. This vision aligns our economic incentives with our deepest desire for healthy communities on a thriving planet.

This is a bold idea with real challenges. Preventing fraud, ensuring accessibility, and stabilizing value are complex design problems. We are tackling these through rigorous research and propose solutions like randomized audits and community oversight. But we can’t do it alone.

This isn’t a finished system—it’s a **rigorous hypothesis** we’re inviting you to help shape. In our next post, we’ll explore the **'Love Ledger'**, a proposed platform to enable Hearts and Leaves. For now, we ask: **How could Leaves work in your community? What challenges do you foresee?** Join us as thought partners at **globalgovernanceframeworks.org** to co-design this blueprint for a regenerative future.
