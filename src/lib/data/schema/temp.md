What I really want is to see us, as a species, collectively mature.

I want to see us heal the deep, systemic, and intergenerational wounds we’ve been perpetuating for centuries; the fragmentation, the extraction, the zero-sum games, and the profound disconnection from ourselves, each other, and the planet.

I want us to have the courage to face the polycrisis, not as a technical problem to be "solved" with another patch, but as a spiritual and relational crisis that demands a total transformation of our consciousness. I want us to move from a civilization based on competition and trauma to one grounded in stewardship, justice, and reciprocity.

I want to see us build the new systems, the scaffolding, that make this maturity possible. Systems that are wise, resilient, and fair, designed from the ground up to regenerate life and value what truly matters: our well-being, our connection, and our role as conscious participants in a living universe.

And ultimately, I want us to build this scaffolding so well that it becomes internalized. I want us to become so collectively wise and attuned that the external structures can gracefully dissolve, leaving behind a global community that coordinates naturally, like a healthy ecosystem.

I don't just want us to survive. I want us to finally, truly flourish.
