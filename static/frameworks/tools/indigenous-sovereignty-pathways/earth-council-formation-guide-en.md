## Purpose and Overview

This guide provides comprehensive protocols for establishing the Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha / Terra Sapiens)—a global Indigenous-led governance body providing moral and spiritual authority for planetary decisions while respecting cultural autonomy and traditional governance systems. The Earth Council serves as the highest coordinating body for bioregional governance, Traditional Knowledge protection, and planetary healing initiatives.

**What is the Earth Council?**
The Earth Council represents global Indigenous moral authority operating through earned respect, traditional protocols, and consensus-based decision-making rather than imposed political power.

- **Inter-Bioregional Mediation**: Conflict resolution between Indigenous communities and ecosystem disputes
- **Protocol Development**: Ethical frameworks for Traditional Knowledge sharing and Indigenous territory engagement
- **Emergency Coordination**: Rapid response for climate disasters, extractive threats, and cultural emergencies
- **Global Indigenous Representation**: Unified Indigenous voice in international forums and planetary governance

**Authority Foundation**:
- **Moral Authority**: Legitimacy through Indigenous wisdom, ecological stewardship, and spiritual guidance
- **Cultural Autonomy**: Respect for diverse Indigenous traditions while providing unified coordination
- **Traditional Governance**: Integration with traditional governance systems rather than replacement
- **Ecological Relationship**: Decision-making guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge and ecological responsibility
