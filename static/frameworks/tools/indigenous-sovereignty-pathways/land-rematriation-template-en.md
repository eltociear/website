## Conclusion: The Path Forward

Land rematriation represents more than property transfer—it embodies the restoration of right relationship between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories, the revival of Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and the emergence of governance systems that serve all beings across seven generations.

This template provides practical tools while honoring the sacred responsibility of territorial stewardship. Success requires patience, persistence, and unwavering commitment to traditional governance, cultural protocols, and community self-determination.

**The vision is clear**: Traditional territories returned to Indigenous stewardship, ecosystems restored through Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and governance systems emerging from the land itself. The template provides the roadmap—the journey requires our collective courage, wisdom, and dedication to the children not yet born.
