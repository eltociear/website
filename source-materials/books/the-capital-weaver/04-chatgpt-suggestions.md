Love the spine—clear arc from principles → tools → GGF “OS,” and the Sarah vignette is a great hook. Here are high-leverage edits to make it land harder and readier-to-use.

## 10 upgrades to the outline

1. **State the reader promise by persona, up front.**
   In the Preface/Intro, add a one-line “What you’ll get” for **philanthropists, impact investors, community funds, family offices**, then breadcrumb those icons through the book. This matches your role split in Chapter 7 and makes the book skim-proof for busy readers. &#x20;

2. **Promote RoR from appendix to core text.**
   Keep Chapter 4 but move a **worked RoR example** (currently Appendix B) into the chapter body with a simple formula + mini case (then link to the spreadsheet in the appendix). Readers shouldn’t have to flip for the “how.” &#x20;

3. **Add a “Capital Stacks for Regeneration” chapter (Part II).**
   Right after the Scorecard, show 3–4 blended-finance archetypes (grant + guarantee + concessional debt + equity), and where **Sundown**/transition tools or **Hearthstone** stewardship trusts slot in. Think visuals + term-sheet snippets.  &#x20;

4. **Make assurance & right-relations its own chapter.**
   Pull the four-step **Assurance Protocol** out of Appendix D and combine it with **Aurora Accord** transparency and **FPIC 2.0** guidance (now scattered in Scorecard notes). This becomes your anti-greenwashing chapter. &#x20;

5. **Portfolio design & risk chapter.**
   Add a chapter on **position sizing, concentration limits, scenario tests**, and a **Regeneration–Return Frontier** (IRR vs. RoR chart). Tie portfolio resilience to **Hearts/Leaves** (AUBI), so fiduciaries see risk math, not just ethics. &#x20;

6. **Surface the standards crosswalk earlier.**
   Keep Appendix E, but add a 1-page “**How this maps to CSRD/ISSB/IRIS+/SDGs**” at the end of Chapter 6 so practitioners can translate the Scorecard into existing IC templates immediately. &#x20;

7. **Deal pipeline chapterlet.**
   In Part III or at the end of Part II, add “**Finding Deals**”: where to source **Venture Commons** listings, how to open an **Aurora-compliant** data room, and how the book’s Scorecard appears in a data-room checklist. (You already reference Venture Commons; give it a page.) &#x20;

8. **Regionalization & Indigenous partnership field guide.**
   Expand the Scorecard’s bullet into a **2-page FPIC 2.0 checklist** + regional adaptation notes (BAZ context, language, local metrics). Place it as a boxed field guide after Chapter 6.&#x20;

9. **Exit & mission-lock in the main text.**
   Promote the **steward-ownership / golden share / community veto** riders (Appendix C) into Chapter 9 so the thesis template includes an exit doctrine, not just diligence. Link to **Hearthstone** for stewardship structures. &#x20;

10. **Teach through cases, every chapter.**
    Keep Appendix C, but add a **“Deal Lab”** vignette at each chapter end (one win, one cautionary), plus **Failure Library** callouts in Chapter 12. This keeps Sarah’s narrative thread alive and practice-oriented. &#x20;

## A crisper flow (proposed tweaks)

* **Part I (Principles):** unchanged, but insert a micro-case at each chapter end.&#x20;
* **Part II (Practice):**

  * Ch.6 Scorecard (add 1-page standards crosswalk preview).&#x20;
  * **Ch.7 Capital Stacks for Regeneration** (new).
  * Ch.8 Four Roles (as is).&#x20;
  * **Ch.9 Assurance & Right-Relations Governance** (new; FPIC 2.0 + Aurora + audit flow).&#x20;
  * **Ch.10 Portfolio Design & Risk** (new; RoR–IRR frontier).
  * Ch.11 Regenerative Investment Thesis (moved to close Part II).&#x20;
* **Part III (GGF OS):** Keep, but frame as **“Go further”** (to avoid pitch-feel): BAZ/Hearthstone/AUBI/Sundown mapped to pains surfaced earlier, with a clear opt-in path.&#x20;

## Visuals & tools to add

* **RoR worked example** (in Ch.4) + **download link to spreadsheet**; Appendix keeps the full walkthrough.&#x20;
* **Regeneration–Return Frontier** scatter; **Hearts/Leaves flow map** for a deal; **capital stack diagrams** for 3 archetypes; **radar chart** for Scorecard (already noted).&#x20;
* **IC-ready one-pager**: a templated **Investment Memo** mapping each Scorecard domain to CSRD/ISSB fields (teased in Ch.6, full in Appendix E).&#x20;

## Style & reader experience

* Keep Sarah’s voice popping up as **chapter cold opens** (2–3 paragraphs each) so the book stays human, not just procedural.&#x20;
* Use consistent **persona icons** in margins to flag sections most relevant to each allocator type (ties to Chapter 7).&#x20;
* Add a **“Quick Wins”** checklist at the end (you already signal this in Ch.12—bring it forward as a tear-out summary too).&#x20;

If you want, I can draft the two new chapters (Capital Stacks; Assurance & Right-Relations) and the RoR worked example so the outline instantly becomes manuscript-ready.
