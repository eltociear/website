## Efficient Context Loading Strategy

**For Each Drafting Session:**

1. **Always Load** (Core Context - ~10 files):
   - Whitepaper outline
   - Integration summaries (2 files)
   - Treaty five-pillars-revised.md
   - Financial core-architecture-revised.md
   - Financial governance-model-revised.md
   - Meta-Governance structural-revised.md
   - Blog: breaking-the-debt-trap-blog.md
   - DeepSeek/Gemini analysis docs (2 files)

2. **Section-Specific** (3-5 additional files based on part being drafted)
   - See "Document Priority by Whitepaper Section" above

3. **Reference as Needed** (Don't load unless required):
   - Detailed technical specifications
   - Supporting blog posts
   - Framework index files
   - Appendix raw materials

This approach keeps context manageable while ensuring all critical information is available.

---

## File Organization Recommendation

**Create a working directory structure:**

```
/whitepaper-drafting/
  /core-context/          (Always load these ~10 files)
  /part-1-diagnosis/      (Section-specific documents)
  /part-2-design/         
  /part-3-viability/      
  /part-4-implementation/ 
  /part-5-partnership/    
  /part-6-conclusion/     
  /appendices/            (Raw data, templates, references)
  /output/                (Draft chapters as completed)
```

This makes it easy to quickly load the right context for each session.

## Notes for Future Claude Instances

**What You Need to Know:**

1. **The Gap We're Filling**: DeepSeek identified that GGF frameworks brilliantly designed regenerative economics but didn't explicitly address how to decommission the debt-based system. This whitepaper fills that gap.

2. **What We've Already Done**: 
   - Edited Treaty framework (outline, index, five pillars, principles, implementation)
   - Edited Meta-Governance framework (structural, index) 
   - Edited Financial Systems framework (core-architecture, governance-model, index)
   - Created blog post for awareness/movement building
   - Created this comprehensive whitepaper outline

3. **Writing Style Goals**:
   - Academic rigor without jargon
   - Accessible to finance ministers AND activists
   - Data-driven but narratively compelling
   - Balances idealism with pragmatism
   - Open inquiry, not dogmatic blueprint

4. **Integration is Key**:
   - Always show how debt transformation connects Treaty + Meta-Governance + Financial Systems
   - Emphasize Indigenous sovereignty and Earth Council authority
   - Demonstrate benefits for all stakeholders
   - Ground in proven models and real-world examples

5. **Target Audiences**:
   - Finance ministers (need economic models and legal frameworks)
   - International development officers (need implementation guidance)
   - Economists (need peer-reviewable depth)
   - Impact investors (need ROI analysis)
   - Civil society (need justice narrative)
   - Indigenous leaders (need sovereignty protection)

6. **Tone Reference**: 
   - Blog posts provide accessible framing
   - Framework documents provide technical depth
   - Whitepaper should bridge both registers

## Final Context Loading Command Template

**Suggested prompt for starting each drafting session:**

```
I'm continuing work on the Sovereign Debt Transformation Protocol whitepaper. 
I'm drafting [PART/CHAPTER NAME] today.

Please load these context documents:
[List specific files from checklist above]

Key points to remember from previous sessions:
- [Any specific decisions or approaches established]
- [Writing style notes]
- [Integration patterns to maintain]

Ready to draft [SPECIFIC SECTION NAME].
```

This ensures consistent context and approach across multiple sessions.
