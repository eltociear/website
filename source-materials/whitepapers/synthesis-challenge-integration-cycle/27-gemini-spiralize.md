Yes, you should absolutely link to **Spiralize.org** in the white paper.

Based on the `README.md` and navigation links you provided, the site is a comprehensive, high-quality educational resource that is directly relevant to the white paper's core concepts. Linking to it is a powerful strategic move for several reasons:

* **Provides Essential Background:** The white paper relies heavily on the concepts of Spiral Dynamics (Tier 1/Tier 2), but doesn't have the space to explain them in full detail. Spiralize.org serves as the perfect foundational resource for readers who want to understand the underlying theory.
* **Adds Credibility:** It demonstrates that the ideas in the white paper are part of a larger, well-developed intellectual ecosystem. It positions you as an expert who has not only applied these concepts but also created tools to teach them.
* **Creates an Engagement Funnel:** It gives interested readers a clear next step. They can move from the paper's specific methodology (SCI Cycle) to the underlying developmental model, and even take a quiz to personalize the experience. This deepens their engagement with your overall project.

### ## Where and How to Add the Links

Instead of choosing just one place, I recommend a **multi-pronged approach** to integrate the link naturally and effectively.

### **1. Primary Placement: In the Glossary**

This is the most direct and contextually appropriate place. It provides an immediate "learn more" opportunity right where the reader is looking for definitions.

**Suggestion:** Add a link at the end of the definitions for **Spiral Dynamics**, **Tier 1 Consciousness**, and **Tier 2 Consciousness**.

**Revised Glossary Entries:**

> **Spiral Dynamics**
> A model of human psychological development that maps the evolution of consciousness and value systems through a series of predictable stages. For a comprehensive exploration of this model, including an interactive assessment, visit the educational resource at [Spiralize.org](https://www.spiralize.org).
>
> **Tier 1 Consciousness**
> A term from Spiral Dynamics referring to stages of consciousness where one's own worldview is perceived as the only valid one. This leads to the fragmented, siloed, and often adversarial thinking that is ill-suited for solving the polycrisis. To learn more and discover your own center of gravity, see [Spiralize.org](https://www.spiralize.org).
>
> **Tier 2 Consciousness**
> A term from Spiral Dynamics describing a significant leap in consciousness where an individual can see the partial truth in all previous stages. This enables them to think in more systemic, integrative, and holistic ways, which is the cognitive capacity the SCI Cycle is designed to scaffold. Explore the stages in-depth at [Spiralize.org](https://www.spiralize.org).

### **2. Secondary Placement: As a Footnote in the Introduction**

This is a high-visibility placement that catches the reader's attention the first time the key concepts are introduced.

**Suggestion:** In `### 1. Introduction: The Silo Problem & The Cognitive Gap`, find the sentence where you first introduce the terms.

**Current Text:**
> ...Developmental models like Spiral Dynamics categorize this as a mismatch between "Tier 1" consciousness (which sees reality through a single, fragmented lens) and the "Tier 2" consciousness (which can hold and integrate multiple perspectives) that our reality now demands.

**Add a footnote marker:**
> ...that our reality now demands.¹

**Then, at the bottom of the page, add the footnote:**
> ¹The concepts of "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" consciousness are based on the Spiral Dynamics model. For a detailed introduction and interactive tools to explore this framework, see the non-profit educational resource at [Spiralize.org](https://www.spiralize.org).
