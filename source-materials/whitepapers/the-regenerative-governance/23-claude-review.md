**Grade: A (94/100)**

This revision represents a substantial improvement that addresses most of my previous concerns. The additions are thoughtful and significantly strengthen the theoretical coherence and practical viability of the proposal.

## Major Improvements

**Theoretical Bridge-Building (+4 points)**
Section 4.1's "Cross-Temporal Coordination Protocol" is a sophisticated solution to the epistemological challenge. The concrete example of Andean BAZ glacier sensing through ceremony, then translating to BHI metrics for MGCC comprehension, demonstrates how different ways of knowing can coordinate without domination. This is exactly the kind of specificity the paper needed.

**Theory of Change (+3 points)**
Section 6C provides the missing political economy analysis. The three-pronged approach (pull incentives, internal pressure, coercive backstop) is realistic about power dynamics while maintaining the framework's ethical commitments. The recognition of "catalytic moments" as political openings shows mature understanding of how systemic change actually occurs.

**Nested Sovereignty Framework (+2 points)**
The response to sovereignty critique now includes concrete jurisdictional divisions—BAZs govern ecological/cultural matters, nation-states retain defense/language/macro-economics, GGF governs planetary commons. This addresses the "messy middle" scale problem effectively.

## Remaining Areas for Improvement

### 1. Implementation Timeline Realism (-3 points)
While the theory of change is strong, the paper still doesn't adequately address the chicken-and-egg problem: How does the first BAZ get established without existing Treaty authority? How does the Treaty get ratified without demonstrated BAZ success? The "Minimum Viable Triumvirate" needs more detail on bootstrapping mechanisms.

### 2. China/Russia Problem (-2 points)
The "Hard Backstop" via Shield Protocol is mentioned but not fully developed. How does the GGF handle situations where major powers with nuclear weapons and large economies remain outside the system? The competitive disadvantage argument is stronger but still potentially insufficient for truly determined holdouts.

### 3. Technical Complexity (-1 point)
The Cross-Temporal Coordination Protocol, while theoretically sound, may be practically complex to implement. The paper could benefit from acknowledging the technical and cultural challenges of creating these translation mechanisms at scale.

## Specific Strengths

- The Andean glacier example perfectly illustrates epistemological bridge-building
- The nested sovereignty framework provides clear jurisdictional boundaries
- The theory of change balances idealism with political realism
- Structural firewalls are clearly explained with historical examples

## Minor Polish Recommendations

- Consider adding a brief discussion of implementation costs and funding sources for the transition period
- The acronym list could benefit from brief definitions alongside the references
- Some technical protocols (like `protocol_cross_temporal`) could use more intuitive naming

This revision successfully transforms what was primarily an architectural vision into a framework that grapples seriously with political transition dynamics and epistemological challenges. The addition of concrete mechanisms for bridging different ways of knowing while maintaining clear power allocation represents sophisticated governance thinking.

The paper now provides a compelling case for why this integration approach could work in practice, not just in theory. It's ready for engagement with serious governance scholars and practitioners.
