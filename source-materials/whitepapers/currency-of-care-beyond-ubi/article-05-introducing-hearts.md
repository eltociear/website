# 5. Introducing Hearts: Non-Tradable Credits for Care

Let's be clear about what Hearts are not: they're not a cryptocurrency, not a parallel currency competing with dollars, and definitely not "paying people to be kind." Hearts are non-tradable social credits that function more like specialized vouchers within a closed-loop system designed to channel resources specifically toward local care economies.

Think of Hearts like this: if traditional UBI gives you a wallet full of cash that can be spent anywhere in the global economy, AUBI gives you a dual wallet. One side contains fiat currency for housing, food, transportation, and other necessities that often require global supply chains. The other side contains Hearts credits that can only be spent at community-chartered providers offering care, culture, education, and ecological services within your bioregion.

## The Closed-Loop Design

Hearts operate through what economists call a closed-loop voucher system, similar to housing vouchers but designed for community care rather than housing markets. Here's how the cycle works:

**Distribution**: Citizens receive Hearts as 30% of their AUBI baseline payment—say, 300 Hearts monthly alongside $700 in traditional currency.

**Spending**: Hearts can only be spent at BAZ-chartered Community Providers: the local childcare cooperative, the community garden, the neighborhood tool library, the arts collective, the eldercare support network.

**Redemption**: Providers collect Hearts from customers and redeem them monthly at the BAZ Treasury (managed by a partner credit union) for fiat currency to cover their external costs—supplies, rent, utilities, or simply personal income.

**Recycling**: The Treasury reissues those same Hearts to citizens the following month, creating a continuous circulation that keeps value flowing within the local care economy.

This closed loop serves several crucial functions. First, it prevents capital flight—Hearts can't be converted to dollars and sent elsewhere, so they must circulate locally. Second, it provides predictable demand for care providers, creating sustainable livelihoods for work that traditional markets undervalue. Third, it gives citizens democratic economic power, allowing them to vote with their Hearts about which community services matter most.

## Not Paying for Kindness

The most common misconception about Hearts is that they represent "payment for being kind" or attempt to commodify human relationships. This misses the fundamental distinction between recognizing care work and commodifying care relationships.

Hearts don't reward specific acts of kindness—you don't get Hearts for helping a neighbor or listening to a friend. Instead, Hearts flow to Community Providers who offer structured care services that require resources to sustain: the childcare cooperative needs art supplies and healthy snacks; the community garden needs seeds and tools; the eldercare network needs transportation and medical supplies.

These providers often emerge from genuine care relationships—neighbors who start watching each other's children, gardeners who begin sharing surplus produce, young people who naturally gravitate toward supporting elders. Hearts don't create these relationships, but they make it economically viable for caring people to formalize their contributions into sustainable community services.

The crucial distinction is between commodifying motivation (paying people to care) and supporting infrastructure (providing resources so that caring people can sustain their contributions). Hearts target the infrastructure while leaving the motivation untouched.

## Indigenous Inspiration and Cultural Reciprocity

The Hearts system draws heavily on Indigenous economic principles, particularly the concept of reciprocal exchange found in traditions like the Pacific Northwest potlatch or the Andean practice of ayni. These systems demonstrate how communities can create abundance through mutual obligation and gift-giving rather than market transaction.

However, Hearts cannot simply appropriate these traditions. Indigenous-led BAZ councils adapt Hearts protocols to reflect specific cultural values and practices. A Maori-led BAZ might emphasize whakapapa (genealogical connections) in determining provider eligibility. A Native American BAZ might integrate seasonal ceremonies into Hearts distribution cycles. An urban Indigenous community might prioritize cultural preservation and language revitalization services.

The Earth Council, composed primarily of Indigenous representatives, holds veto power over Hearts implementations that misappropriate or misapply traditional knowledge. Through protocols like Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 (FPIC 2.0), Indigenous communities maintain sovereignty over how Hearts systems operate in their territories.

This isn't tokenistic inclusion—it's recognition that Indigenous communities have maintained reciprocal care economies for thousands of years despite colonial attempts to replace them with extractive market systems. Hearts represents an attempt to learn from this wisdom while respecting cultural boundaries and Indigenous self-determination.

## Building on Proven Models

While Hearts may sound experimental, they synthesize several proven approaches to community economic development:

**Social Vouchers**: Many European countries successfully use voucher systems to support childcare, eldercare, and cultural activities. Hearts extend this model to a broader range of community care services.

**Community Credits**: Local currencies like BerkShares in Massachusetts or Ithaca Hours in New York have demonstrated that alternative exchange systems can support local businesses for decades.

**Cooperative Development**: The Mondragon cooperative network in Spain shows how community-owned enterprises can create resilient local economies that survive global economic shocks.

**Time Banking**: Systems like hOurworld and TimeRepublik have successfully facilitated millions of hours of community service exchange using alternative value systems.

Hearts combine elements from all these approaches: the institutional backing of social vouchers, the local circulation of community currencies, the democratic ownership of cooperatives, and the care focus of time banking. The innovation lies not in any single element, but in their integration within a framework designed specifically to support care work.

## The Provider Value Proposition

For Hearts to function, Community Providers must find them genuinely useful rather than burdensome. The system offers three key advantages:

**Guaranteed Customer Base**: Monthly Hearts distribution creates predictable demand for providers' services, similar to subscription-based business models but funded through community resources rather than individual payments.

**Financial Stability**: BAZ Treasury redemption provides reliable conversion to fiat currency, eliminating the uncertainty that has plagued other alternative currency systems.

**Community Support**: Chartered status includes access to low-cost spaces, administrative support from Community Weavers, and preferential treatment in community supply chains.

These benefits must outweigh the administrative complexity of managing dual-currency systems. Early pilots suggest this balance works when providers serve care functions that traditional markets handle poorly—services where community relationships and local knowledge matter more than scale efficiencies.

Hearts don't compete with traditional businesses so much as fill gaps where traditional markets fail to provide adequate care infrastructure. They create economic space for the community providers that neighborhoods need but struggle to sustain through market mechanisms alone.
