Yes, you're right. The visuals are a crucial part of making these complex ideas accessible and are mentioned in the latest article outline.

Here are three detailed prompts you can provide to Claude to generate the necessary SVGs. These prompts are designed to be clear and specific, incorporating the latest "Stewardship" theme colors we developed.

***

### **Prompt 1: The Closed-Loop `Hearts` System (Infographic)**

"Please create a clean, modern, infographic-style SVG diagram illustrating a closed-loop economic cycle. The diagram should be circular and feature four distinct nodes connected by arrows to show a continuous flow.

* **Style:** Minimalist, professional, and clear. Use simple, universally understandable icons.
* **Key Nodes & Icons:**
    1.  **Top Node:** Labeled "**AUBI / BAZ Treasury**." Icon: A simple, stylized building with a heart or a leaf symbol on it.
    2.  **Right Node:** Labeled "**Citizens / Community**." Icon: A diverse group of three stylized people.
    3.  **Bottom Node:** Labeled "**Community Providers**." Icon: A cluster of three smaller icons representing care (a hand holding a heart), art (a paintbrush), and food (a seedling).
    4.  **Left Node:** This node is part of the return arrow, not a separate stop.
* **Flow & Arrow Labels:**
    1.  Arrow from **Treasury** to **Citizens**: Labeled "**Unconditional `Hearts` Credit Distribution**."
    2.  Arrow from **Citizens** to **Providers**: Labeled "**Spending on Local Care, Art & Food**."
    3.  Arrow from **Providers** back to **Treasury**: Labeled "**Providers Redeem `Hearts` for Fiat Currency**."
* **Color Palette (Stewardship Theme):**
    * Background: A very light, neutral gray (`--financial-light: #E2E8F0`).
    * Main Icons & Text: A deep charcoal (`--financial-dark: #1A202C`).
    * `Hearts` Symbolism: Use the Muted Red (`--financial-hearts: #C53030`) for the heart icons and to accent the word `Hearts`.
    * Arrows: Use the Slate Blue (`--financial-primary: #2C5282`).
* **Overall Feel:** The graphic should clearly communicate a stable, regenerative, and closed-loop system."

### **Prompt 2: The Four-Layered AUBI Model (Tree Diagram)**

"Please create an infographic-style SVG of a healthy, stylized tree to illustrate the four layers of the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) model. The layers should be represented by different parts of the tree, from the roots up to the canopy.

* **Style:** Elegant, organic, and professional. The tree should look stable and nourishing.
* **Key Layers & Labels:**
    1.  **The Roots:** A complex and deep root system, clearly visible in the soil. Label this section: "**Layer 0: Relational Wealth**." Add smaller keywords around the roots: "Kinship," "Trust," "Indigenous Wisdom," "Gratitude Tokens."
    2.  **The Trunk:** The strong, stable base of the tree. Label this section: "**Layer 1: Universal Baseline**." Add keywords: "Adaptive Security," "Hybrid Fiat/`Hearts`," "Crisis Responsive."
    3.  **The Main Branches:** The large, fruit-bearing branches. Label this section: "**Layer 2: Contribution Bonus**." The branches should have both hearts and leaves on them. Add keywords: "`Hearts` for Care," "`Leaves` for Ecology," "Community Work."
    4.  **The Canopy:** The protective, overarching canopy of leaves. Label this section: "**Layer 3: Equity Bonus**." Add keywords: "Reparations," "Disability Support," "Justice."
* **Color Palette (Stewardship Theme):**
    * Roots & Soil: A thoughtful Charcoal Gray (`--financial-wisdom: #4A5568`).
    * Trunk: A stable Slate Blue (`--financial-primary: #2C5282`).
    * Branches: A dark brown or charcoal.
    * Leaves on branches: The Sage Green (`--financial-leaves: #38A169`).
    * Hearts on branches: The Muted Red (`--financial-hearts: #C53030`).
    * Canopy: The Forest Green (`--financial-secondary: #2F855A`).

    2.  **Step 2 Box:** Title: "**Create Proto-Treasury**." Text: "The circle pools a small amount of fiat and issues the first `Hearts` credits to themselves, proving the model." Icon: A piggy bank with a heart on it.
