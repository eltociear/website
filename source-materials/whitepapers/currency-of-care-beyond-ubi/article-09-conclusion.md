# An Economy as if People and Planet Mattered

Picture Maria Rodriguez, whose story opened our exploration of the care economy, five years from now. She still wakes early to care for her children, still works her hospital shift, still checks on elderly neighbors. But now, alongside her regular paycheck, she receives 300 Hearts monthly through her AUBI payment.

These Hearts flow to the providers who make her community life richer: the parent cooperative that provides reliable after-school care for her children, the community garden where she gets fresh vegetables and her kids learn about growing food, the neighborhood repair cafe where broken appliances get fixed instead of thrown away. The local credit union manages the BAZ Treasury that ensures providers can convert their Hearts to dollars when needed for supplies or rent.

Maria's informal care—the bedtime stories, the neighbor check-ins, the volunteer hours at the community center—receives recognition through the Love Ledger without being commodified. Her LMCI dashboard shows how her community has grown stronger: more care hours logged, deeper social connections, improved ecological health through community stewardship projects.

This isn't utopia. The Hearts system requires ongoing governance through her neighborhood BAZ council. Disputes sometimes arise about provider standards or Hearts allocation. Economic pressures from the broader market system still create stress and uncertainty. But Maria's community has developed some resilience against external shocks, some agency over local economic flows, and some recognition that care work constitutes real economic activity deserving of support.

## The Paradigm Shift We're Testing

The vision isn't just better funding for care work, though that matters. It's not just community self-reliance, though that helps. The deeper goal is testing whether we can create economic systems that strengthen rather than consume their own foundations.

Our current economy treats care work, ecological health, and social cohesion as free inputs that markets can extract indefinitely. When care providers burn out, when ecosystems degrade, when communities fragment, the economy requires expensive interventions to patch the damage. We end up paying far more to repair social and ecological breakdown than we would spend supporting the care work that prevents it.

The Hearts system tests whether economic systems can be designed to regenerate their foundations instead of consuming them. By making care work economically visible and sustainable, by creating community ownership over local value flows, by measuring success through wellbeing rather than just production, Hearts experiments with what economists call "regenerative" rather than "extractive" economics.

But this remains a hypothesis requiring rigorous testing rather than a proven solution ready for global implementation.

## What We Would Learn

The proposed research program is designed to generate insights that would inform community economic development regardless of whether Hearts specifically succeed or fail. This research would allow us to learn about the conditions under which community governance remains democratic rather than captured by local elites. We would discover how dual-currency systems affect small business operations and consumer behavior. The program would document which institutional partnerships strengthen community resilience and which create new vulnerabilities.

The proposed Comparative Pilot Portfolio is designed to provide data about whether systemic acupuncture actually works better than symptom treatment. In some contexts, direct funding for care services may prove more effective than complex Hearts systems. In others, community-owned value circuits may demonstrate superior resilience to economic shocks or political changes. Either outcome would advance our understanding of community economic alternatives.

The research program's value would lie not in proving Hearts are the solution, but in generating reliable knowledge about what kinds of economic interventions can address the persistent challenges of care work invisibility, economic insecurity, and community fragmentation.

## The Invitation Continues

This is not a call for communities to abandon traditional economic approaches or bet their futures on untested systems. It is an invitation to help build and participate in what may be the most comprehensive research program on community economic alternatives ever attempted.

Communities joining as research sites contribute to global knowledge while potentially improving their own conditions. Academic institutions gain access to unprecedented data about economic innovation. Policymakers receive evidence-based recommendations about alternative approaches to social safety nets and community resilience.

The research succeeds regardless of whether Hearts prove superior to simpler alternatives. Even negative results advance understanding of what works and what doesn't in community economic development, informing better approaches to persistent social and economic challenges.

## Beyond the Pilot Phase

If Hearts systems prove effective, the implications extend beyond individual communities. Bioregional federations could influence regional economic policy. National governments might experiment with community-owned value systems as complements to traditional social programs. International development organizations could support Hearts-inspired approaches in contexts where centralized programs have struggled.

If Hearts systems prove ineffective or harmful, the documented failures will inform better approaches to community economic development. Either way, the research generates knowledge that advances the field rather than simply promoting one particular model.

The goal isn't implementing Hearts globally, but discovering what kinds of economic systems can actually deliver the security, agency, and connection that communities need to thrive in an uncertain world.

## A Final Thought

The burnout that opened this article—the exhaustion that comes from living in systems that demand constant productivity while treating care as worthless—reflects a deeper misalignment between human needs and economic structures. Universal Basic Income addresses part of this problem by providing security, but it leaves the value crisis untouched.

The Hearts system represents one attempt to heal that misalignment by creating economic systems that recognize care work, strengthen community resilience, and measure success through wellbeing rather than just output. Whether this specific approach proves effective remains an open question requiring careful research rather than ideological commitment.

But the underlying challenge—designing economies that support rather than undermine human and ecological flourishing—will persist regardless of whether Hearts succeed or fail. The research program's broader purpose is contributing to humanity's ongoing experiment in creating economic systems worthy of our highest aspirations rather than merely our most expedient arrangements.

The invitation remains open. Not to embrace Hearts as a solution, but to join the inquiry into what kinds of economic systems can actually sustain the care work that sustains us all.
