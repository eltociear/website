The non-tradable credits approach is a significant improvement that addresses several core concerns, but important challenges remain:

## Major Improvements

**Eliminates Currency Mechanics Problems**: The closed-loop voucher system elegantly solves inflation, valuation, and capital flight issues. By making Hearts non-convertible to fiat for individuals, you've removed the most problematic aspects of parallel currency systems.

**Clearer Value Proposition**: Framing this as "channeling resources to local care" rather than "creating a new currency" makes the purpose much more concrete and defensible.

**Proven Model Foundation**: Building on voucher systems like housing vouchers or food stamps provides a stronger empirical foundation than experimental local currencies.

## Remaining Concerns

**Implementation Complexity Still High**: You still need to establish BAZ councils, Charter Community Providers, create Treasury systems, train Community Weavers, and coordinate across multiple governance layers. The operational complexity remains substantial.

**Provider Network Viability**: The system depends entirely on having enough Community Providers offering valuable services. What ensures sufficient participation? How do providers handle the mixed fiat/Hearts revenue model? Many care providers operate on thin margins and may not be able to navigate a dual payment system.

**Bureaucratic Capture Risk**: BAZ councils determining Hearts values, chartering providers, and managing treasuries creates multiple points where local politics or special interests could distort the system. You've reduced but not eliminated governance complexity.

**Scalability Questions**: The article mentions "BAZs (e.g., Canada, Sweden)" but doesn't explain how a voucher system designed for bioregional communities scales to nation-state contexts. How do you coordinate Hearts systems across different BAZs?

**Evidence Base**: The article still lacks concrete examples of where similar closed-loop community credit systems have worked at meaningful scale. LETS systems, which are perhaps the closest analogue, have remained quite small and niche.

## Missing Analysis

**Transition Friction**: How do existing care providers (daycare centers, elder care, etc.) transition to accepting Hearts? What are the compliance costs and administrative burdens?

**Exit/Failure Scenarios**: What happens when Community Providers go out of business? When BAZ councils make poor decisions? When people accumulate Hearts they can't spend effectively?

**Equity Concerns**: Could this create two-tier care systems where Hearts-accepting providers offer different quality services than fiat-only providers?

The voucher reframing is a substantial improvement that makes the concept more workable. However, the article would be stronger if it acknowledged these remaining implementation challenges while making the case for careful experimentation rather than presenting AUBI as ready for broad adoption.
