The revision shows meaningful improvement in addressing key concerns, but significant issues remain:

## Positive Changes

**Simplified Structure**: The two-part system (fiat + Hearts baseline, plus non-monetized Love Ledger) is much clearer than the original four-layer complexity.

**Commodification Mitigation**: Decoupling Hearts from specific logged actions and making them unconditional baseline payments does reduce the risk of commodifying individual care acts.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: The emphasis on Indigenous-led design and FPIC 2.0 shows genuine effort to avoid appropriation.

## Persistent Problems

**Fundamental Feasibility**: The revised system still requires unprecedented coordination between local currencies, governance structures, and parallel economic systems. You haven't adequately addressed why this would succeed where similar experiments (Ithaca Hours, community currencies) have struggled to achieve meaningful scale.

**Hearts Currency Mechanics**: Critical questions remain unanswered:
- Who determines Hearts issuance rates and exchange values?
- What prevents Hearts inflation or deflation relative to local economies?
- How do you ensure sufficient merchant acceptance to make Hearts useful?
- What happens if people prefer to convert Hearts to fiat rather than spend locally?

**Governance Complexity**: The Social Resilience Council, Earth Council veto, BAZs, and Community Weavers create a governance structure that may be more complex than the problem it solves. How do you prevent these bodies from becoming bureaucratic bottlenecks or sites of political capture?

**Economic Assumptions**: The claim that this avoids "gaming" because Hearts are baseline rather than earned misunderstands human behavior. People will still find ways to extract maximum value, convert to preferred currencies, or manipulate the system for advantage.

**Evidence Gaps**: References to "pilots in BAZs" and "phased rollout" remain largely hypothetical. The article would be stronger with concrete examples of where similar dual-currency systems have worked at meaningful scale.

## Missing Critical Analysis

**Transition Costs**: How much would it cost to establish this parallel infrastructure? Who pays for Community Weavers, governance bodies, and technology platforms?

**Unintended Consequences**: What happens when Hearts create new forms of inequality, exclude people who can't navigate the system, or become sites of social control?

**Exit Strategy**: If the system fails or causes harm, how do communities disengage without losing resources invested?

The core insight about valuing care work remains important, but the solution still appears to add complexity without clearly demonstrating why simpler approaches (like care worker wages, care tax credits, or expanded social services) wouldn't achieve similar goals with less risk.

The article would be stronger if it acknowledged these limitations while making the case for experimentation rather than presenting AUBI as a comprehensive solution.
