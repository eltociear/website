This revision shows substantial progress in addressing implementation concerns, particularly around provider economics and governance transparency. The analysis of why providers would participate and the corruption prevention measures add necessary rigor.

## Meaningful Improvements

**Provider Value Proposition**: The three-part analysis (guaranteed redemption, new customer base, BAZ support) directly addresses network viability concerns. The housing voucher analogy strengthens the empirical foundation.

**Governance Accountability**: Adding transparent chartering criteria and appeals to the Digital Justice Tribunal reduces (though doesn't eliminate) corruption risks.

**Honest Limitation Acknowledgment**: The new FAQ question about implementation challenges and the conclusion's acknowledgment of remaining complexities shows appropriate intellectual humility.

**Scalability Mechanism**: The Inter-Currency Translation Layer provides a clearer path for BAZ coordination without requiring national mandates.

## Remaining Substantive Concerns

**Circular Dependency Problem**: The system requires BAZ councils, Community Weavers, Digital Justice Tribunals, and Social Resilience Councils to all function effectively simultaneously. If any component fails, the whole system becomes vulnerable. There's no clear bootstrapping sequence.

**Provider Network Critical Mass**: Even with incentives, you need sufficient provider density for Hearts to be useful to recipients. How do you solve the chicken-and-egg problem of building provider networks before recipients have Hearts to spend?

**Administrative Burden**: Despite Community Weaver support, providers still must handle dual payment systems, monthly redemptions, compliance with chartering criteria, and quality standards. For small care providers operating on thin margins, this could be prohibitively complex.

**Evidence Gap**: The article still lacks concrete examples of successful closed-loop community credit systems at meaningful scale. Housing vouchers work because they're backed by government treasuries with deep resources - BAZ Treasuries would need to demonstrate similar reliability.

**Political Feasibility**: The article doesn't address how BAZs would gain the authority to operate Treasuries, issue credits, and manage complex governance systems within existing legal frameworks.

The voucher model represents a significant conceptual improvement that resolves the most problematic currency mechanics. However, the operational complexity remains high enough that the article would be stronger positioning this as an interesting experiment to test rather than a ready-to-implement solution. The intellectual honesty in acknowledging limitations is a strength that could be expanded.
