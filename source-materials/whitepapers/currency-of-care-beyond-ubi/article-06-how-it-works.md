# How It Works: The Mechanics of a Regenerative Economy

The Adaptive Universal Basic Income operates as a dual-wallet system: fiat currency for global needs, Hearts credits for local care. But how does this work in practice? What does it look like when someone receives their monthly AUBI payment, and how do the various components—baseline payments, provider networks, governance structures, and measurement systems—fit together into a functioning whole?

## The Two-Part AUBI Foundation

Every month, AUBI recipients receive their baseline payment split between two complementary systems. The fiat portion—roughly 70% of the total—covers essentials that typically require global supply chains: rent or mortgage payments, grocery bills, utilities, transportation, healthcare premiums, and other necessities best served by traditional markets.

The Hearts portion—the remaining 30%—flows exclusively into the local care economy. Unlike fiat currency that can travel anywhere in the global economy, Hearts can only be spent at community-chartered providers within the recipient's bioregion. This geographic constraint isn't a limitation but a feature: it ensures that this portion of the economic stimulus remains local, building community wealth rather than leaking to distant shareholders.

The payment system adapts dynamically to local conditions. During economic downturns, the fiat percentage might increase to ensure basic security. During ecological crises—wildfire evacuations, flood recovery, pandemic lockdowns—emergency protocols can adjust both the total amount and the fiat/Hearts ratio to meet immediate needs while maintaining long-term community resilience.

Funding comes through three primary mechanisms that align incentives toward community and ecological wellbeing. An Automation Tax captures 5-25% of productivity gains when companies achieve significant labor cost reductions through technology—ensuring that technological advancement benefits communities rather than just shareholders. Resource taxes on carbon emissions, extraction, and land use create revenue while discouraging ecological damage. Commons dividends from digital infrastructure, natural resource extraction, and other shared assets provide sustainable funding that grows with economic activity.

For young adults, the system includes optional civic internships for ages 16-18, providing early introduction to community contribution while maintaining the unconditional nature of the baseline. These internships offer real work experience in community organizations, ecological restoration, or cultural preservation, with participants receiving both regular AUBI payments and additional Hearts bonuses for their contributions.

## The Provider Economy: Making Care Work Viable

Community Providers form the backbone of the Hearts system—the childcare cooperatives, community gardens, arts collectives, eldercare networks, tool libraries, and skill-sharing organizations that accept Hearts in exchange for services. But why would existing care providers choose to complicate their operations by accepting a new form of payment?

The value proposition rests on three pillars. First, guaranteed redemption eliminates the risk that alternative currencies typically pose. The BAZ Treasury, managed by partner credit unions, provides reliable monthly conversion of accumulated Hearts into fiat currency. Providers face no uncertainty about whether their Hearts will retain value—the community has committed to backing them at a stable exchange rate.

Second, Hearts create a guaranteed customer base. Traditional care markets often struggle with irregular demand—childcare providers face enrollment fluctuations, community gardens struggle with inconsistent volunteer participation, arts organizations depend on unpredictable attendance. Monthly Hearts distribution creates steady, recurring demand for provider services, similar to subscription-based business models but funded collectively rather than individually.

Third, chartered status brings additional community support. The Hearthstone Protocol provides access to low-rent community spaces for provider operations. Community Weavers offer technical support for dual-payment systems, helping providers integrate Hearts acceptance into existing point-of-sale systems and manage monthly redemption processes. Supply chain prioritization helps providers access materials and services from other Hearts-accepting businesses, creating internal value loops that reduce dependence on external fiat transactions.

Administrative challenges exist—managing dual currencies requires additional bookkeeping, and providers must navigate occasional regulatory questions about alternative payment systems. However, pilot data suggests these burdens become manageable when offset by the stability and community support that Hearts provide.

Quality standards prevent the emergence of two-tier service systems where Hearts-accepting providers offer inferior services. Community Weavers work with providers to maintain service quality while managing costs, and the transparent chartering process includes ongoing peer review and community feedback mechanisms.

## Resilience Through Redundancy

The Hearts system's resilience comes through multiple overlapping safeguards rather than single points of failure. Legal resilience emerges through formal Partnership Charters—multi-year agreements between BAZ communities, credit union partners, and municipal governments that include dispute resolution mechanisms and exit clauses protecting all parties against political changes or institutional shifts.

Economic resilience develops as Community Providers increasingly form cooperatives that create internal Hearts value loops. The childcare cooperative purchases produce from the community garden cooperative, which buys tools from the repair cooperative, which provides services to the childcare families. These internal circuits reduce dependence on fiat redemption while maintaining the Treasury backing that provides ultimate stability.

Scaling resilience emerges when multiple BAZ communities form bioregional federations. The Inter-Currency Translation Layer allows Hearts to flow between connected BAZ systems, pooling resources for larger projects while maintaining local democratic control. Citizens moving between federated BAZs can continue using their Hearts, while providers can access customers from neighboring communities.

Social resilience builds through deep community integration. Public LMCI dashboards demonstrate measurable improvements in care hours, community cohesion, and ecological stewardship, creating political defense against attempts to terminate Hearts programs. Unlike top-down social programs that communities receive passively, Hearts require active participation that builds civic engagement and democratic capacity.

## The Love Ledger: Recognition Without Commodification

Parallel to the Hearts economy runs the Love Ledger—a transparent, community-led platform for making care contributions visible without monetizing them. While Hearts flow to structured Community Providers, the Love Ledger recognizes the informal care that holds communities together: the neighbor who checks on elderly residents, the parent who organizes playground cleanups, the teenager who teaches digital skills to seniors.

The Love Ledger operates more like a community recognition system than an economic exchange. Contributions are logged and acknowledged through Gratitude Tokens, badges, or simple public recognition, but these symbols don't convert to Hearts or other economic value. The separation is intentional—some care relationships become healthier when supported by community resources (hence Hearts for Community Providers), while others become corrupted by economic calculation (hence non-monetary recognition for informal care).

Community Weavers facilitate Love Ledger participation, helping communities develop culturally appropriate ways to recognize contributions without creating social pressure or commodifying relationships. In some communities, this might involve monthly storytelling circles where contributions are shared and celebrated. In others, it might include digital platforms where community members can offer gratitude and recognition.

The Love Ledger serves multiple functions beyond recognition. It provides data for LMCI calculations, helping communities understand their care economy patterns and identify areas needing additional support. It creates social connections by making invisible contributions visible, allowing community members to discover shared interests and complementary skills. It builds cultural continuity by documenting traditional knowledge sharing, storytelling, and other practices that preserve community wisdom.

## Governance: Democratic but Not Chaotic

Hearts systems require ongoing governance to set exchange rates, charter new providers, resolve disputes, and adapt to changing community needs. This governance operates through democratically elected BAZ Councils that manage local operations while connecting to broader coordination networks.

BAZ Councils typically include 5-9 members serving staggered terms, elected through processes adapted to local democratic traditions. Some communities use consensus-based decision-making inspired by Indigenous practices. Others employ ranked-choice voting or other innovative democratic techniques. The key principle is that governance remains accountable to Hearts users rather than external authorities.

Higher-level coordination happens through the Social Resilience Council, which sets global principles and standards while allowing local adaptation. Indigenous representation holds veto power over implementations that misappropriate traditional knowledge or violate cultural protocols. The Earth Council provides additional oversight to ensure Hearts systems support rather than undermine ecological integrity.

Dispute resolution follows restorative rather than punitive principles. Community courts, staffed by trained mediators, address conflicts between providers and users, governance disputes, and other tensions that arise within Hearts systems. The Digital Justice Tribunal handles appeals and cross-community disputes, with transparent precedents that build consistency while respecting local autonomy.

This governance structure balances democratic participation with practical functionality. Community members can influence decisions that affect their daily economic lives, but they aren't required to micromanage complex technical operations. Professional support—Community Weavers, credit union partners, technical platforms—handles routine administration while communities focus on values, priorities, and vision.

The result is a system complex enough to function reliably but simple enough for communities to understand and control. Hearts don't eliminate the need for economic coordination, but they relocate that coordination to democratic institutions accountable to communities rather than distant shareholders or bureaucracies.
