# An Invitation to a Global Research Program

We must be honest about what we're proposing. The AUBI framework with Hearts credits is not a proven solution ready for global implementation. It's a hypothesis—a carefully structured but unproven theory about how community-owned value circuits might create more resilient, equitable economies than the centralized funding systems we currently rely on.

This hypothesis deserves testing, but it requires acknowledging the fundamental uncertainty involved. We don't know whether Hearts will succeed where other alternative currencies have failed. We don't know whether the complexity of BAZ councils, Community Weavers, and provider cooperatives is necessary infrastructure or bureaucratic overhead. We don't know whether community-owned value circuits can scale beyond neighborhood experiments to regional or global impact.

These unknowns aren't weaknesses in the proposal—they're the reason for conducting rigorous research rather than making unsupported claims about economic transformation.

## The Core Research Questions

The Global Governance Framework's AUBI research program is designed to answer three fundamental questions about community economic resilience:

**Primary Question**: Under what conditions are community-owned value circuits (like Hearts) more resilient and effective at fostering well-being than centralized funding streams? This question gets to the heart of our systemic acupuncture hypothesis—whether targeted interventions can actually heal root causes rather than just treating symptoms.

**Secondary Question**: What are the most effective protocols for aggregating local economic experiments into coherent regional systems without losing local autonomy? This addresses the scalability challenge that has limited most community currency experiments to small, isolated networks.

**Tertiary Question**: Is the complexity we've built into the AUBI framework necessary to prevent systemic failures observed in simpler community models, or does it create more problems than it solves? This tests whether our institutional design assumptions actually improve outcomes.

These aren't rhetorical questions. They represent genuine uncertainty about economic system design that can only be resolved through careful experimentation with proper control groups and comparative analysis.

## Research Methodology: The Comparative Pilot Portfolio

Rather than implementing Hearts systems in isolation, the research program uses a Comparative Pilot Portfolio that tests different approaches simultaneously across diverse contexts. Each bioregion participating in the research program launches three parallel experiments:

**Type A (Full AUBI Model)**: A community implementing the complete Hearts system—BAZ councils, Community Weavers, provider cooperatives, Love Ledger, LMCI measurement, and the four-layered resilience framework.

**Type B (Simpler Alternative)**: A matched community receiving equivalent funding through traditional approaches—direct grants to care providers, wage subsidies for care workers, expanded municipal services, or other straightforward interventions.

**Type C (Control Group)**: A community receiving no intervention beyond baseline data collection, providing comparison points for measuring the impact of both experimental approaches.

This three-arm design addresses the evidence gap directly. Instead of claiming Hearts are superior to simpler alternatives, the research program creates conditions where relative effectiveness can be measured empirically. Communities implementing Type A and Type B interventions receive equivalent resource inputs, allowing fair comparison of outcomes.

The portfolio spans diverse contexts to test generalizability: Indigenous-led communities in Canada, urban neighborhoods in Sweden, rural villages in Kenya, and other settings that represent different cultural, economic, and political conditions. This diversity ensures findings apply beyond the specific circumstances of individual pilots.

Each pilot would track both quantitative measures—LMCI scores, economic resilience indicators, care work hours, community cohesion metrics—and qualitative outcomes through regular community interviews, provider surveys, and participant observation studies.

## Validation Protocols and Falsifiability

Scientific integrity requires defining what would constitute evidence that the Hearts hypothesis is wrong. The research program includes explicit falsifiability criteria: if Type A pilots consistently underperform Type B pilots across multiple contexts after five years of operation, the core hypothesis about community-owned value circuits will be considered falsified.

This triggers a major redesign process coordinated through the Meta-Governance Framework, incorporating lessons learned from pilot failures to develop alternative approaches. The research program's value lies not just in proving Hearts work, but in generating reliable knowledge about what doesn't work in community economic development.

Validation happens through multiple mechanisms. The Knowledge Translation and Synthesis Process analyzes data across pilots to identify cross-cutting principles that appear to work across different contexts versus adaptations that work only in specific cultural or economic circumstances.

External evaluators—academic researchers not affiliated with the Global Governance Framework—conduct independent assessments of pilot outcomes using established social science methodologies. These evaluations are published in peer-reviewed journals regardless of whether results support or contradict the Hearts hypothesis.

Community-controlled evaluation ensures that academic measures capture what actually matters to participants. Community members define their own success criteria, which may differ from researcher assumptions about what constitutes positive outcomes.

## Phased Timeline and Success Metrics

The research program operates across three phases, each with specific goals and success criteria:

**Phase 1 (Years 1-5): Viability Test** focuses on basic functionality. Can Hearts systems operate reliably? Do providers find them useful? Do citizens engage meaningfully with community economic choices? Success means demonstrating that Type A pilots function as intended, regardless of whether they outperform alternatives.

Key metrics include operational stability (pilots continuing to function), provider participation rates (target: 50+ providers per pilot), Hearts circulation velocity (target: 90% of issued Hearts spent monthly), and basic LMCI improvements (target: 10% increase in care hours logged).

**Phase 2 (Years 6-10): Resilience and Scalability Test** examines whether successful pilots can handle stress and growth. How do Hearts systems respond to economic downturns, political changes, or community conflicts? Can they expand from neighborhood to bioregional scale while maintaining democratic governance?

Success metrics include survival rates through economic or political disruptions, successful scaling to regional federations, and maintenance of community satisfaction ratings above 70% even during challenging periods.

**Phase 3 (Years 11-15): Systemic Integration Test** explores whether Hearts can contribute to broader economic transformation. Can successful bioregional networks influence policy at national or international levels? Do Hearts principles inform new approaches to social safety nets, community development, or economic measurement?

Success means generating policy recommendations based on solid empirical evidence, influencing at least five national governments to experiment with community-owned value systems, and contributing to academic literature on alternative economic models.

## Transparency and Adaptation

The research program would commit to radical transparency about both successes and failures. The proposed Failure Library would document setbacks, mistakes, and unexpected problems in detail, making this information freely available to other researchers and communities considering similar experiments.

This transparency would serve scientific integrity but also build public trust. Communities considering participation in Hearts pilots could review honest assessments of what has and hasn't worked in previous attempts, making informed decisions about whether to join the research program.

Adaptation protocols would allow pilots to modify their approaches based on emerging evidence. If certain elements of the Hearts system prove problematic while others show promise, communities could experiment with hybrid approaches that combine successful elements with novel solutions.

The research program would operate more like an open-source development project than a traditional policy implementation. Communities would contribute not just participation but insights, innovations, and improvements that benefit the broader network of experimental sites.

## The Invitation

This isn't a call to implement Hearts systems based on faith in their superiority. It's an invitation to participate in potentially the most comprehensive comparative research program on community economic alternatives ever attempted.

Communities joining as research sites contribute to global knowledge about economic system design while potentially improving their own economic conditions. Academic institutions gain access to unprecedented data about community economic innovations. Policymakers receive evidence-based recommendations about alternative approaches to social safety nets and community development.

The research program succeeds regardless of whether Hearts prove superior to simpler alternatives. Even negative results advance our understanding of what works and what doesn't in community economic development, informing better approaches to the persistent challenges of care work invisibility, economic insecurity, and community resilience.

We're not asking communities to bet their economic futures on an unproven system. We're asking them to join a collective research effort to discover what kinds of economic systems can actually deliver the security, agency, and connection that communities need to thrive.
