# From Pilot to Scale: The BAZ Implementation Pathway

The Hearts system faces a classic chicken-and-egg problem: you need providers willing to accept Hearts before citizens have incentive to use them, but providers won't participate without an established customer base. Most alternative currency experiments have foundered on exactly this coordination challenge.

The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) implementation pathway addresses this through a carefully sequenced bootstrapping process that starts impossibly small and scales through strategic partnerships. Rather than attempting to launch a complete economic system, it begins with what we call the "BAZ Starter Pack"—a process so simple it can be initiated by five committed neighbors with a shared bank account.

## The Grassroots Pilot: BAZ Starter Pack

**Step 1: The Convening Circle**
The process begins when a small group—typically 5-10 people—decides to test whether a local care economy can actually work. This Convening Circle doesn't need special expertise, legal authority, or significant funding. They simply need to identify one community need they can address collectively: a tool-lending library, a community garden, a skill-sharing network, or a neighborhood childcare cooperative.

In Burlington, Vermont, a group of parents frustrated with expensive childcare costs formed such a circle around a shared playgroup. In Oakland, California, neighbors concerned about food access started with a community garden. The key is beginning with something concrete and immediately useful rather than abstract economic theory.

**Step 2: The Proto-Treasury**
Once the Circle has established their pilot project, they create what we call a Proto-Treasury—initially nothing more sophisticated than a shared bank account seeded with modest contributions from members, often $1,000 or less total. This fund serves as the backing for the first Hearts credits.

The Circle issues themselves Hearts credits at a fixed rate—say, 10 Hearts per hour of contribution to the pilot project—and spends these Hearts at their own Community Provider. When the provider (in this case, themselves) redeems Hearts at the Proto-Treasury, they receive fiat currency to cover external costs like supplies or space rental. This creates the closed-loop model in microcosm, proving the concept works before scaling up.

**Step 3: Provider Recruitment**
With a functioning micro-pilot demonstrating the Hearts mechanism, the Circle begins recruiting additional Community Providers. They offer a compelling value proposition: guaranteed customers (Circle members), guaranteed redemption (through the Proto-Treasury), and community support (through word-of-mouth promotion).

Early providers often include local artists, skilled craftspeople, small-scale food producers, and other care economy participants who struggle with traditional market dynamics. The Burlington childcare circle recruited a local pottery studio, a community acupuncturist, and a bicycle repair cooperative. Each provider expands the network's utility while requiring minimal additional overhead.

**Step 4: Governance Formalization**
Only after establishing a functioning micro-economy with multiple providers and regular Hearts circulation does the community formalize governance structures. They elect a BAZ Council to manage the growing Treasury, establish transparent criteria for chartering new Community Providers, and train Community Weavers to support network expansion.

This sequence is crucial: governance emerges from demonstrated success rather than preceding it. Communities don't need to solve complex coordination problems theoretically before testing whether the basic concept creates value.

## The Bridge to Legitimacy: Scaling Through Partnership

The Starter Pack can demonstrate viability with 50-100 participants, but meaningful economic impact requires growth to thousands. This transition happens through strategic partnerships that leverage existing institutions rather than competing with them.

**Phase 2: Formalizing the Treasury**
Instead of managing growing sums in basic bank accounts, successful pilot communities partner with local credit unions or community banks to create formal BAZ Treasury funds. This provides several critical advantages: regulatory compliance, professional financial management, FDIC insurance, and institutional credibility that reassures both providers and municipal partners.

Credit unions prove particularly suitable partners because they already serve community development missions and understand member-owned economic structures. The Hearts system becomes another tool in their community-building toolkit rather than a threat to traditional banking.

**Phase 3: Building the Provider Network**
Rather than recruiting providers individually, scaling communities partner with local Chambers of Commerce, small business associations, or cooperative development organizations. These partnerships can subsidize the administrative costs for the first 50-100 providers joining the Hearts network.

Community Weavers—trained facilitators who understand both Hearts mechanics and local business needs—provide hands-on technical support for dual-payment systems. They help providers integrate Hearts acceptance into existing point-of-sale systems, manage the monthly redemption process, and navigate any regulatory requirements.

**Phase 4: Securing Legal Authority**
The final scaling phase involves formal partnership with municipal government through what we call Public-Commons Partnerships. Rather than requesting permission to create alternative currencies, successful BAZ communities offer to manage specific municipal functions more effectively than traditional approaches.

For example, a BAZ might propose managing local park maintenance, after-school programming, or senior services using Hearts-supported community providers. In exchange, the municipality provides legal charter and official recognition for the Hearts system as a sanctioned community development initiative.

This partnership model transforms Hearts from an alternative currency into a municipal innovation program, eliminating regulatory concerns while demonstrating public value.

## Why This Pathway Works

The BAZ implementation pathway succeeds where other alternative currency experiments have failed because it solves three fundamental problems:

**Trust Building**: By starting small and scaling gradually, communities build trust through demonstrated results rather than theoretical promises. Each phase provides evidence for the next level of institutional partnership.

**Institutional Legitimacy**: Rather than challenging existing institutions, the pathway creates mutually beneficial partnerships. Credit unions gain new community development tools; municipalities gain more effective service delivery; business associations gain support for local commerce.

**Risk Management**: The phased approach limits downside risk at each stage. If the Starter Pack fails, participants lose small amounts of time and money. If scaling partnerships don't work, communities can maintain smaller-scale operations indefinitely.

The pathway also addresses a crucial psychological barrier: most people can imagine participating in a neighborhood-scale experiment, even if they can't envision systemic economic transformation. By starting with the possible, the BAZ approach creates stepping stones toward the transformative.

This isn't just theory. Similar progression patterns have appeared in successful community development initiatives from Transition Towns to Community Supported Agriculture. The difference is that Hearts provides a specific mechanism for capturing and circulating the value created through community cooperation.

The next question becomes: what exactly are Hearts, and how do they function within this implementation framework?
