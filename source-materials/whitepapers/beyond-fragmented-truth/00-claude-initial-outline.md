## I. Introduction: The Meta-Question
- Why investigating "how we know what we know" reveals more than investigating "what we know"
- The convergence problem: Why disparate traditions reach similar conclusions
- Thesis: Universal insights about reality's nature are accessible through reasoning alone

## II. The Two-Level Framework
- Distinguishing relative truth (contextual, practical) from absolute Truth (fundamental, unchanging)
- How this distinction appears across cultures and traditions
- The paradox: Why Truth appears to have direction while remaining unchanging

## III. Cross-Traditional Pattern Analysis
- **The Observer Problem**: Why consciousness studying itself reveals consistent insights
- **The Duality Collapse**: How subject-object distinctions dissolve under scrutiny
- **The Directional Paradox**: Reality's apparent evolution vs. its fundamental changelessness
- **The Knowledge Asymptote**: Why deeper investigation leads to "unknowing"

## IV. The Reasoning Path
- **Step 1**: Examining the nature of experience itself
- **Step 2**: The self-reference problem in consciousness
- **Step 3**: The limits of conceptual frameworks
- **Step 4**: What remains when frameworks dissolve

## V. Implications and Verification
- How this reasoning-based approach validates traditional insights
- Practical applications without requiring special states
- The democratization of profound understanding

Would you like me to develop any particular section, or should we refine the overall structure first?
