Love this direction. Here are focused upgrades that will make the Social Fabric Framework “implementation-ready” and cleanly dock it into the rest of GGF:

1. Clarify role boundaries + an interface protocol
   Add a short “Inter-Weaver Interface” that distinguishes **Community Weavers** (cohesion + trust) from **Safety Weavers** (de-escalation/safety) and **Recovery Weavers** (addiction/healing), with handoff triggers and consent rules. Include a 2-way escalation map and shared ethics (confidentiality, do-no-harm).  &#x20;

2. Add a Cohesion Council “Terms of Reference” mini-charter
   Specify sortition/quotas (elders, youth, marginalized), quorum, consent-based decision model, conflict-of-interest, and a yearly public report tied to LMCI deltas. (You already propose the Council—this tightens governance.)&#x20;

3. Measurement you can run with next week
   Expand the LMCI section into a **Cohesion Metrics Pack**:

* Core: LMCI baseline/Δ, participation rate, event recurrence, conflict-to-repair ratio.
* Network: bridging vs. bonding ties (simple Kumu/adjacency template).
* Equity: inclusion scores for disability, youth, Indigenous members.
  Publish on a lightweight dashboard (Digital Commons node) with privacy by design. &#x20;

4. Data & privacy guardrails (copy the good bits)
   Mirror CCSF’s **Anti-Surveillance Covenant** and “data as three-fold commons” (personal / community / public). Define what is never collected (e.g., sensitive narratives), who can query anonymized LMCI, and retention windows.&#x20;

5. Phase gates with readiness thresholds
   At the end of each phase, add clear “advance” criteria (e.g., Phase-1 → Phase-2 requires LMCI +5%, ≥2 functioning Third Places, ≥30% cross-group participation). That makes this a true playbook, not just a guide.&#x20;

6. Minimum Viable Practice (MVP) kit → “3-3-3”
   You already have the **Community Supper & Story Circle**. Package an MVP kit as: 3 gatherings, over 3 weeks, with 3 tiny reciprocity acts (tool swap, childcare chain, cook-share). Provide printable scripts and safety notes.&#x20;

7. Funding that unlocks quickly
   Operationalize the **Social Cohesion Seed Grant**: budget bands (small/medium/large community), eligible costs (Weaver stipends, venue, childcare, micro-grants), and auto-replenish rules when LMCI milestones are hit. Pay Weavers in **Hearts** + fiat; show how AUBI Layer-1/2 covers ongoing roles. &#x20;

8. Risk & failure patterns (make them explicit)
   Add a “Red Flags & Antidotes” table: charismatic capture, cultural tokenism, retraumatization, factionalization, burnout. Include a **Weaver Ombud** path and peer-debrief requirement (monthly) to keep practice hygienic.&#x20;

9. Contextual adaptation matrices
   Borrow CCSF’s adaptation style and add matrices for rural/urban, post-conflict, diaspora, authoritarian contexts (with offline kits and low-tech rituals), plus climate-event overlays (Third Places as resilience hubs).&#x20;

10. Training & certification ladder
    Spell out the **Community Weaver Curriculum** (NVC, somatics, restorative basics, anti-bias, disability inclusion, network weaving, basic evaluation). Create Apprentice → Practitioner → Senior tracks, with cross-credits toward Safety/Recovery Weavers to build a true “Weaver Guild.” &#x20;

11. Interoperability snapshot table
    Add a one-pager like CCSF’s “GGF Interoperability Summary” showing how Social Fabric is **Phase-0** for Meta-Gov, feeds AUBI onboarding, uses Digital Commons for tool sharing, and when to invoke Justice/Peace frameworks. &#x20;

12. Narrative + assets
    Ship a tiny comms kit: a 150-word “What is Community Weaving?” (public-facing), a flyer template, and a one-slide flow (“Call → Supper Circle → Reciprocity Micro-grant → Cohesion Council”). Host the assets on a Commons node for reuse.&#x20;

If you like, I can fold these directly into the draft with: a) a new “Cohesion Metrics Pack” appendix, b) ToR template, c) Inter-Weaver Interface, and d) Seed-Grant rubric.
