### 1. Introduction: Weaving Collective Care from the Fabric of Community

#### The Challenge

Traditional policing models, rooted in coercion and punishment, have failed to create true safety, often escalating conflicts, traumatizing individuals, and ignoring root causes like poverty, mental health crises, neurodiversity needs, and social alienation. These systems are misaligned with community well-being, necessitating a transformative alternative.

#### The Opportunity

The Collective Care & Safety Framework (Restorative Community Safety) equips communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to create safety systems grounded in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It shifts from reactive, force-based responses to proactively addressing harm’s root causes, prioritizing neurodiversity, disability justice, and Indigenous sovereignty. Trained specialists mediate conflicts, connect people to support, and facilitate healing, making safety a collective, inclusive achievement.

#### Transformative Integration Pathway

Rather than reforming existing police forces, the framework adopts a "Third Force" model:
- **Primary Response**: Community Safety Weavers handle over 90% of safety needs (disputes, wellness checks, mental health crises) as the default first responders.
- **Repurposed Role**: Existing police are downsized and repurposed into a specialized **Severe Harm Response Unit (SHRU)**, activated only by the Community Safety Council or Safety Weavers per the Harm Escalation Protocol for immediate, severe physical threats.
- **Subordinate Function**: The SHRU is not a proactive patrol force but a reactive unit, subject to retraining in de-escalation and restorative principles, with actions reviewed by the Community Safety Council and the Healing Justice Tribunal.
- **GGF Integration**: SHRU personnel are retrained under the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework and Mental Health Governance Framework, recognized within the Work in Liberation Framework as "guardians of last resort."

This approach subsumes necessary functions of legacy systems into a care-based paradigm, facilitating a safe transition toward a post-punitive model.

#### Systemic Position

This framework is a core Tier 2 application, serving as the GGF’s frontline, community-level justice and safety system. It integrates with:
- **Justice Systems Framework**: Handles harms restoratively locally, escalating to the Healing Justice Tribunal only for severe cases.
- **Shield & Aegis Protocols**: Address systemic threats; this framework manages interpersonal/community harm.
- **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**: Trains in values-based conflict transformation.
- **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**: Supports, but is subordinate to, Indigenous justice systems in BAZs.
- **Mental Health Governance Framework**: Supports Crisis Sanctuaries and Harm Reduction Teams.
- **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**: Ensures neurodiversity and accessibility.
- **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework**: Coordinates local efforts in large-scale emergencies.
- **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**: Guides protocols for intimate partner violence and child protection.
- **Youth & Future Generations Integration Protocol**: Ensures youth participation.

### 2. Core Principles

1. **Safety as Collective Well-being**: Safety is the presence of connection, trust, and resources for all, including neurodivergent and disabled individuals, not the absence of crime.
2. **Restorative Justice First**: Prioritizes facilitated processes addressing the needs of the harmed, the person causing harm, and the community for repair over punishment.
3. **De-escalation by Default**: Unarmed specialists trained in mediation, de-escalation, and trauma-informed care are first responders.
4. **No Coercive Force Covenant**: Prohibits deadly force, using non-violent resolution and temporary community-held safe spaces for extreme cases.
5. **Addressing Root Causes**: Tackles economic insecurity, trauma, mental health challenges, neurodiversity needs, and lack of belonging.
6. **Primacy of Indigenous Justice**: In BAZs, Indigenous justice systems are paramount, with a Red Lines Clause allowing modification/rejection of framework components (per Indigenous Governance Framework).
7. **Community Ownership and Accountability**: Systems are designed, staffed, and overseen by communities, ensuring cultural resonance.
8. **Fractal Governance**: Allows hyper-local adaptations within BAZs.
9. **Neurodiversity & Disability Justice**: Prioritizes accessibility, co-designed with the Global Disability Alliance.
10. **Intergenerational Healing**: Addresses how current harms impact future generations.
