# The Collective Care & Safety Framework v1.1

**Subtitle**: Restorative Community Safety  
**Tier**: 2 (Foundational Application Layer)  
**Status**: Revised Draft  
**Implementation Priority**: High  

---

### 1. Introduction: Weaving Collective Care from the Fabric of Community

#### **The Challenge**

Traditional policing models, rooted in coercion and punishment, have failed to create true safety, often escalating conflict, traumatizing individuals, and ignoring root causes like poverty, mental health crises, and social alienation. This leaves a gap for a system that fosters healing, not punishment, and builds community resilience from within.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Collective Care & Safety Framework (Restorative Community Safety) equips communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to create safety systems grounded in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It shifts from reactive, force-based responses to proactively addressing harm’s root causes. Trained specialists mediate conflicts, connect people to support, and facilitate healing, making safety a collective achievement, not an imposed order.

#### **Systemic Position**

This framework is a core Tier 2 application, serving as the GGF’s frontline, community-level justice and safety system. It operates in a nested relationship with other frameworks:

- **Justice Systems Framework**: Handles harms restoratively at the local level. Escalation to the Healing Justice Tribunal occurs only when restorative processes fail, are refused, or for severe harms as defined by the community.
- **Shield & Aegis Protocols**: Address systemic threats (e.g., transnational crime, military conflict). This framework manages interpersonal and community-level harm, preventing unnecessary escalation.
- **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**: Trains community members to apply values-based transformation to disputes.
- **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**: In BAZs, this framework’s tools support, but are subordinate to, sovereign Indigenous justice systems.
- **Mental Health Governance Framework**: Provides tools and support systems that Harm Reduction Teams connect community members with.

### 2. Core Principles

1. **Safety as Collective Well-being**: Safety is the presence of connection, trust, and resources for all to thrive, not merely the absence of crime.
2. **Restorative Justice First**: The primary response to harm is a facilitated process addressing the needs of the victim, the person who caused harm, and the community, prioritizing repair over punishment.
3. **De-escalation by Default**: Unarmed specialists trained in mediation and de-escalation are first responders. Coercive force is an absolute last resort, governed by strict protocols.
4. **No Coercive Force Covenant**: The framework explicitly prohibits deadly force, prioritizing non-violent resolution and temporary community-held safe spaces for extreme cases.
5. **Addressing Root Causes**: Safety stems from tackling economic insecurity, trauma, mental health challenges, and lack of belonging.
6. **Primacy of Indigenous Justice**: In sovereign BAZs, Indigenous justice and safety systems are paramount. This framework offers resources, not directives.
7. **Community Ownership and Accountability**: Safety systems are designed, staffed, and overseen by the communities they serve, ensuring cultural resonance and accountability.
8. **Fractal Governance**: Hyper-local adaptations within BAZs allow neighborhoods to tailor the framework to their unique needs.

### 3. Structural Components & GGF Integration

#### 3.1. Governance: The Community Safety Council

- **Mandate**: A BAZ-level or municipal council overseeing the local Collective Care & Safety system, setting priorities, managing resources, and ensuring accountability.
- **Composition**: Community members selected via sortition, with reserved seats for elders, youth, and marginalized groups. In BAZs, the council integrates with or is subordinate to Indigenous governance structures.
- **Powers**:
  - Hires and oversees Community Safety Weavers, Harm Reduction & Support Teams, and Crisis Sanctuary staff.
  - Manages budgets allocated from the Global Commons Fund (mechanism_gcf).
  - Defines the local Harm Escalation Protocol, specifying offenses requiring referral to the Justice Systems Framework.

#### 3.2. Operational Teams: The Pillars of Collective Care

- **Community Safety Weavers**:
  - **Role**: Unarmed first responders and peacekeepers trained in de-escalation, mediation, conflict transformation, trauma-informed care, and somatic healing practices per the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework.
  - **Function**: Respond to non-emergency disputes, welfare checks, and disturbances, facilitating on-the-spot mediation.
  - **GGF Integration**: Recognized as a profession under the Work in Liberation Framework, rewarded with Hearts on the Love Ledger.
- **Harm Reduction & Support Teams**:
  - **Role**: Specialists connecting individuals to resources addressing harm’s root causes, trained in trauma-informed care and somatic healing.
  - **Function**: Provide case management and warm hand-offs to mental health (Mental Health Governance Framework), housing, addiction support, and economic security (AUBI Framework) services.
  - **GGF Integration**: Link the principle of “Addressing Root Causes” to GGF’s social support systems.
- **Restorative Justice Circles**:
  - **Role**: Community-led processes addressing harm post-occurrence.
  - **Function**: Facilitators convene circles with the person harmed, the person who caused harm, and community members to understand impacts, address needs, and plan repair and reintegration. Circles can apply for GCF resources for material reparations.
  - **GGF Integration**: Primary justice mechanism, with outcomes logged on a secure, local Love Ledger to track restorative agreements.
- **Solidarity Circles**:
  - **Role**: Proactive, preventative pods addressing systemic biases, power dynamics, and emergent conflicts before harm occurs.
  - **Function**: Small, affinity-based groups meeting regularly for mutual aid and early intervention, applying Peace Framework principles.
  - **GGF Integration**: Recognized as community care work under the AUBI Framework, eligible for Hearts rewards.
- **Accountability Pods**:
  - **Role**: Intensive restorative process for high-harm or repeat-harm cases before escalation to the Justice Systems Framework.
  - **Function**: Rotating community teams trained in transformative justice facilitate extended processes to address complex cases.
  - **GGF Integration**: Final restorative step before formal escalation to the Digital Justice Tribunal.

#### 3.3. Key Infrastructure & Protocols

- **Crisis Sanctuaries**:
  - **Role**: Non-carceral, 24/7 spaces for people in acute distress (e.g., psychosis, suicidal ideation), staffed by peers and healers.
  - **Function**: Co-governed by the Community Safety Council and the Mental Health Governance Framework’s local body, offering alternatives to police or medicalization.
  - **GGF Integration**: Joint venture with the Mental Health Governance Framework.
- **Community Safety Platform**:
  - **Role**: Multi-lingual app and phone line for requesting non-emergency support from Safety Weavers or Harm Reduction Teams.
  - **Function**: Any AI or algorithmic triage features undergo continuous, open-source bias audits by the GGF’s Office of Algorithmic Accountability (per TGIF and Aurora Accord).
- **De-escalation Protocol**: Standard procedure for Safety Weavers, emphasizing non-violent communication, empathy, and resolution space.
- **Harm Escalation Protocol**: Community-defined protocol specifying harms (e.g., severe violence, systemic exploitation) requiring escalation to the Healing Justice Tribunal or Shield Protocol. Accountability Pods serve as an intermediate step for complex cases.

### 4. Economic Model & GGF Integration

- **Funding**: Primarily funded by the mechanism_gcf (Global Commons Fund), allocated by the Community Safety Council, treating safety as a public good.
- **Community Safety Bonds**: Financial tool within the Financial Systems Framework, enabling municipalities to divest from carceral budgets and invest in the GCF.
- **AUBI & Hearts Integration (framework_aubi)**:
  - AUBI Layer 1’s economic security prevents crimes of desperation.
  - Community Safety Weavers, Restorative Justice Facilitators, and Solidarity Circle participants earn Hearts via the Love Ledger, creating a regenerative economic loop valuing care work.
- **Reparative Justice Fund**: Restorative Justice Circles can access GCF resources for material reparations (e.g., housing, land access) agreed upon in processes.

### 5. Measuring Regenerative Safety

- **Metrics**:
  - **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Tracks collective efficacy (% of conflicts resolved restoratively), material well-being (housing stability, food security), and joy indicators (community festivals, shared meals).
  - **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**: Measures environmental well-being at the BAZ level.
- **Community Well-being Dashboard**:
  - Mandatory, public-facing, real-time tool tracking metrics like “conflicts resolved restoratively,” “access to support services,” and “days since last escalation to formal justice.”
  - **GGF Integration**: Aligns with the Aurora Accord’s transparency principles.

### 6. Implementation Pathway

- **Phase 1: Seeding & Training (Years 1-2)**:
  - Launch emergent pilots in 3-5 diverse BAZs/municipalities with strong community trust, encouraging guerrilla prototypes (e.g., single Crisis Sanctuary).
  - Establish training academies for Community Safety Weavers, integrating Peace Framework and Indigenous knowledge keepers.
  - Develop the open-source Community Safety Platform.
- **Phase 2: Scaling & Integration (Years 3-5)**:
  - Expand to more communities, creating regional support hubs.
  - Integrate Harm Escalation Protocol with the Justice Systems Framework.
  - Build evidence of effectiveness via LMCI and BHI shifts.
- **Phase 3: Global Standard (Years 6+)**:
  - Establish the framework as the GGF-supported default for local safety.
  - Create a global practitioner network sharing best practices via the framework_digital_commons.

### 8. Conclusion: Collective Care Woven, Not Waged

The Collective Care & Safety Framework shifts from control and punishment to relationship and repair. Safety is not imposed but woven through daily interactions in connected, supported communities. By providing tools for de-escalation, restorative justice, and root cause solutions, this framework empowers communities to create their own well-being, rooted in care and solidarity.
