# The Restorative Community Safety Framework v1.0

**Tier**: 2 (Foundational Application Layer)
**Status**: First Draft
**Implementation Priority**: High

---

### 1. Introduction: Weaving Safety from the Fabric of Community

#### **The Challenge**

Traditional policing models, often rooted in coercion and punishment, have failed to create true safety for many communities. They frequently escalate conflict, traumatize individuals, and neglect the root causes of harm—such as poverty, mental health crises, and social alienation. This leaves a critical gap: a system for addressing day-to-day safety that is healing rather than punitive, and that builds community resilience from the ground up.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Restorative Community Safety Framework provides the tools for communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to build their own safety systems rooted in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It shifts the focus from reacting to crime with force to proactively addressing the conditions that lead to harm. This framework equips communities with trained specialists who mediate conflict, connect people with support, and facilitate healing, creating a world where safety is a collective achievement, not an imposed order.

#### **Systemic Position**

This framework is a core Tier 2 application that serves as the GGF's frontline, community-level justice and safety system. It operates in a nested relationship with other frameworks:

- It is the preventative and restorative counterpart to the GGF's formal justice systems:
  - Justice Systems Framework: This framework handles harms restoratively at the local level. Only when restorative processes are refused or fail, or for severe harms as defined by the community, does escalation to the formal Healing Justice Tribunal occur.
  - Shield Protocol & Aegis Protocol: These frameworks address high-level systemic threats (transnational crime, military conflict). This framework handles interpersonal and community-level harm, ensuring that local issues do not needlessly escalate into the purview of high-level security.

- It is the implementation of the GGF's peace and healing philosophies:
  - Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework: This framework trains and deploys community members to apply the principles of values-based transformation to local disputes.
  - Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework: Within BAZs, this framework's tools are offered in service to, and are subordinate to, sovereign Indigenous justice and safety systems. It provides resources, not directives.
  - Mental Health Governance Framework: Provides the essential tools and support systems that Harm Reduction Teams connect community members with.

### 2. Core Principles

1. Safety as Collective Well-being: True safety is not the absence of crime, but the presence of connection, trust, and the resources needed for all members of a community to thrive.
2. Restorative Justice First: The primary response to harm is a facilitated process that addresses the needs of the victim, the person who caused harm, and the community, aiming for repair over punishment.
3. De-escalation by Default: The first responders to community conflict are unarmed specialists trained in mediation and de-escalation. Coercive force is an absolute last resort, governed by strict protocols.
4. Addressing Root Causes: Safety is created by addressing the underlying drivers of harm, including economic insecurity, trauma, mental health challenges, and lack of belonging.
5. Primacy of Indigenous Justice: Within sovereign BAZs, traditional and Indigenous systems of justice and safety are paramount. This framework provides optional tools and resources to support, not supplant, these systems.
6. Community Ownership and Accountability: Safety systems are designed, staffed, and overseen by the communities they serve, ensuring they are culturally resonant and accountable.

### 3. Structural Components & GGF Integration

#### 3.1. Governance: The Community Safety Council

- Mandate: A BAZ-level or municipal council responsible for overseeing the local Restorative Community Safety system. It sets priorities, manages resources, and ensures accountability to the community.
- Composition: Composed of community members selected through sortition (civic lottery), with reserved seats for elders, youth, and representatives from marginalized groups. In BAZs, this council is integrated into or subordinate to traditional Indigenous governance structures.
- Powers:
  - Hires and oversees the Community Safety Weavers and Harm Reduction & Support Teams.
  - Manages the local budget allocated from the Global Commons Fund (mechanism_gcf).
  - Defines the local Harm Escalation Protocol, determining which offenses require immediate referral to the formal Justice Systems Framework.

#### 3.2. Operational Teams: The Pillars of Community Safety

- Community Safety Weavers:
  - Role: Unarmed first responders and peacekeepers of the community. They are trained professionals skilled in de-escalation, mediation, and conflict transformation, applying the methodologies of the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework.
  - Function: Respond to non-emergency calls for disputes, welfare checks, and public disturbances. They facilitate on-the-spot mediation and are the primary interface for the community's safety needs.
  - GGF Integration: This is a recognized profession within the Work in Liberation Framework, and their community-building work is rewarded with Hearts on the Love Ledger.
- Harm Reduction & Support Teams:
  - Role: Specialists who connect individuals with the resources needed to address the root causes of harmful behavior.
  - Function: Work with individuals referred by Safety Weavers or Restorative Justice Circles. They are case managers who provide warm hand-offs to services for mental health (Mental Health Governance Framework), housing, addiction support, and economic security (AUBI Framework).
  - GGF Integration: They are the critical link that makes the principle of "Addressing Root Causes" operational, connecting this framework to the GGF's broad social support systems.
- Restorative Justice Circles:
  - Role: A community-led process for addressing harm after it has occurred.
  - Function: When harm happens, trained community facilitators convene a circle including the person harmed, the person who caused harm, and affected community members. The goal is to understand the impacts, address the needs of the victim, and create a collective plan for repair and reintegration.
  - GGF Integration: This is the primary justice mechanism of the framework. Outcomes are logged on a secure, local version of the Love Ledger to track the completion of restorative agreements. It is the practical application of the restorative principles outlined in the Justice Systems Framework.

#### 3.3. Key Tools & Protocols

- Community Safety Platform: An accessible, multi-lingual app and phone line for community members to request non-emergency support from Safety Weavers or Harm Reduction Teams.
- De-escalation Protocol: The standard operating procedure for Safety Weavers, emphasizing non-violent communication, empathy, and creating space for resolution.
- Harm Escalation Protocol: A clear, community-defined protocol that specifies which harms (e.g., severe violence, systemic exploitation) are immediately escalated to the formal Healing Justice Tribunal or require the intervention of the Shield Protocol (if transnational crime is involved). This ensures community safety without compromising accountability for severe offenses.

### 4. Economic Model & GGF Integration

- Funding: The framework is primarily funded by the mechanism_gcf (Global Commons Fund), with allocations managed by the local Community Safety Council. This treats community safety as a public good, not a municipal budget line item to be cut.

- AUBI & Hearts Integration (framework_aubi):
  - The economic security provided by AUBI Layer 1 is the single most powerful tool for preventing crimes of desperation.
  - The work of Community Safety Weavers and Restorative Justice Facilitators is recognized as vital community care and is rewarded with Hearts via the Love Ledger. This creates a regenerative economic loop where the work of creating safety is valued and supported by the community's economy.

### 5. Implementation Pathway

- Phase 1: Seeding & Training (Years 1-2):
  - Pilot the framework in 3-5 diverse BAZs and municipalities that have strong community trust and a desire to move beyond traditional policing.
  - Establish the first training academies for Community Safety Weavers, in partnership with the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework and local Indigenous knowledge keepers.
  - Develop the Community Safety Platform as an open-source tool.
- Phase 2: Scaling & Integration (Years 3-5):
  - Expand to a wider network of communities, establishing regional support hubs.
  - Fully integrate the Harm Escalation Protocol with the Justice Systems Framework.
  - Develop a robust body of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in reducing harm and increasing community well-being (measured by the LMCI).
- Phase 3: Global Standard (Years 6+):
  - The Restorative Community Safety model becomes the default GGF-supported approach for local safety.
  - A global network of practitioners shares best practices through the framework_digital_commons.

### 6. Conclusion: Safety Woven, Not Waged

The Restorative Community Safety Framework offers a profound shift—from a paradigm of control and punishment to one of relationship and repair. It recognizes that safety is not something that can be imposed by an external force; it is something that is woven from the daily interactions of a connected, supported, and empowered community. By providing the tools for de-escalation, restorative justice, and addressing root causes, this framework empowers communities to become the primary creators of their own safety and well-being.
