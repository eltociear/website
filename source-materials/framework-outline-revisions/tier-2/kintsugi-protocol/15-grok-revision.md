# The Collective Care & Safety Framework v1.5

**Subtitle**: Restorative Community Safety  
**Tagline**: From reaction to restoration: safety built on care, not coercion  
**Tier**: 2 (Foundational Application Layer)  
**Status**: Revised Draft  
**Implementation Priority**: High

### 1. Introduction: Weaving Collective Care from the Fabric of Community

#### The Challenge
Traditional policing, rooted in coercion, escalates conflicts, traumatizes individuals, and ignores root causes like poverty, mental health crises, neurodiversity needs, and social alienation. These systems fail to foster true safety, necessitating a transformative, community-led alternative.

#### The Opportunity
The Collective Care & Safety Framework (Restorative Community Safety) equips communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to create safety systems grounded in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It prioritizes neurodiversity, disability justice, Indigenous sovereignty, and systemic reparations, shifting from reactive force to proactive healing. Trained specialists mediate conflicts, connect people to support, and facilitate repair, making safety a collective achievement.

#### Transformative Integration Pathway
The framework adopts a "Third Force" model to transition from legacy policing:
- **Primary Response**: Community Safety Weavers handle over 90% of safety needs (disputes, wellness checks, mental health crises) as default first responders.
- **Repurposed Role**: Existing police are downsized into a **Severe Harm Response Unit (SHRU)**, activated only by the Community Safety Council or Safety Weavers per the Harm Escalation Protocol for immediate, severe threats.
- **Subordinate Function**: The SHRU is a reactive unit, prohibited from carrying firearms or lethal weapons (Disarmament Clause), equipped with trauma-informed tools (e.g., weighted blankets, biofeedback devices), and subject to retraining and review by the Community Safety Council and Healing Justice Tribunal.
- **GGF Integration**: SHRU personnel are retrained under the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework and Mental Health Governance Framework, recognized as "guardians of last resort" within the Work in Liberation Framework.
- **Community Veto Power**: Communities may dissolve the SHRU if it violates restorative principles, replacing it with rotating community defense pods trained in nonviolent intervention.

#### Systemic Position
This Tier 2 framework is the GGF’s frontline community-level justice and safety system, integrating with:
- **Justice Systems Framework**: Handles local restorative processes, escalating to the Healing Justice Tribunal for severe cases.
- **Shield & Aegis Protocols**: Manages systemic threats; this framework addresses interpersonal/community harm.
- **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**: Trains in conflict transformation.
- **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**: Supports Indigenous justice systems in BAZs.
- **Mental Health Governance Framework**: Supports Crisis Sanctuaries and Harm Reduction Teams.
- **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer (Foundation Protocol)**: Ensures neurodiversity and accessibility.
- **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework**: Coordinates emergency efforts.
- **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**: Guides intimate partner violence protocols.
- **Youth & Future Generations Integration Protocol**: Ensures youth participation.
- **Regenerative Enterprise Framework**: Informs reparations for organizational harm.
- **Global Mobility Passport**: Supports transient populations.
- **Cultural Heritage Framework**: Guides cross-cultural mediation and translations.
- **Technology Governance Framework (TGIF)**: Ensures ethical technology use.

### 2. Core Principles
1. **Safety as Collective Well-being**: Safety is connection, trust, and resources for all, including neurodivergent and disabled individuals.
2. **Restorative Justice First**: Prioritizes facilitated repair over punishment.
3. **De-escalation by Default**: Unarmed specialists are first responders.
4. **No Coercive Force Covenant**: Prohibits deadly force, using non-violent resolution. **Disarmament Clause**: The SHRU is prohibited from carrying firearms or lethal weapons, using trauma-informed tools and requiring annual de-escalation recertification.
5. **Addressing Root Causes**: Tackles economic insecurity, trauma, and exclusion.
6. **Primacy of Indigenous Justice**: Indigenous systems are paramount in BAZs, with a Red Lines Clause allowing modification/rejection of framework components.
7. **Community Ownership and Accountability**: Systems are community-designed and overseen.
8. **Neighborhood-Led Adaptation**: Enables hyper-local implementations (fractal governance, where communities tailor the framework to their unique needs).
9. **Neurodiversity & Disability Justice**: Prioritizes accessibility, co-designed with the Global Disability Alliance. **Nothing About Us Without Us Clause**: All disability-related protocols are co-designed and audited by the Global Disability Alliance, with veto power over harmful practices.
10. **Intergenerational Healing**: Addresses impacts on future generations.
11. **Safeguard Against Co-optation**: Rejects implementations prioritizing state/corporate control or using restorative language to mask punitive practices.

### Appendix: Community Guide
**What is the Collective Care & Safety Framework?**

This framework helps your community stay safe without police or punishment. It focuses on healing conflicts, supporting everyone’s needs, and fixing problems like poverty or mental health struggles.

- **How it Works**:
  - **Safety Weavers**: Trained neighbors who help solve conflicts peacefully, like calming arguments or checking on someone in need.
  - **Circles**: Groups that bring people together to talk, heal harm, and make things right.
  - **Sanctuaries**: Safe, calm spaces for people in distress, with support for mental health or sensory needs.
- **Who Runs It**: Your community, through a council chosen fairly, including youth, elders, and diverse voices.
- **Why It Matters**: It builds trust, keeps everyone included, and makes your community stronger and happier.

**Get Involved**: Contact your Community Safety Council, join a Solidarity Circle, or use the Community Safety Platform (app or phone line) to get help or learn more.

**What Happens When You Call for Help?**  
*See infographic*: A call goes to the Community Safety Platform → A Safety Weaver responds → They connect you to support, a Circle, or a Sanctuary → Serious cases may involve a community defense pod or tribunal, but only as a last resort.
