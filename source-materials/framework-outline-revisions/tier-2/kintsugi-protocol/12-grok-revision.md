### 1. Introduction: Weaving Collective Care from the Fabric of Community

#### The Challenge

Traditional policing, rooted in coercion, escalates conflicts, traumatizes individuals, and ignores root causes like poverty, mental health crises, neurodiversity needs, and social alienation. These systems fail to foster true safety, necessitating a transformative, community-led alternative.

#### The Opportunity

The Collective Care & Safety Framework (Restorative Community Safety) equips communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to create safety systems grounded in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It prioritizes neurodiversity, disability justice, and Indigenous sovereignty, shifting from reactive force to proactive healing. Trained specialists mediate conflicts, connect people to support, and facilitate repair, making safety a collective achievement.

#### Transformative Integration Pathway

The framework adopts a "Third Force" model to transition from legacy policing:
- **Primary Response**: Community Safety Weavers handle over 90% of safety needs (disputes, wellness checks, mental health crises) as default first responders.
- **Repurposed Role**: Existing police are downsized into a **Severe Harm Response Unit (SHRU)**, activated only by the Community Safety Council or Safety Weavers per the Harm Escalation Protocol for immediate, severe threats.
- **Subordinate Function**: The SHRU is a reactive unit, retrained in de-escalation and restorative principles, with actions reviewed by the Community Safety Council and Healing Justice Tribunal.
- **GGF Integration**: SHRU personnel are retrained under the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework and Mental Health Governance Framework, recognized as "guardians of last resort" within the Work in Liberation Framework.

#### Systemic Position

This Tier 2 framework is the GGF’s frontline community-level justice and safety system, integrating with:
- **Justice Systems Framework**: Handles local restorative processes, escalating to the Healing Justice Tribunal for severe cases.
- **Shield & Aegis Protocols**: Manages systemic threats; this framework addresses interpersonal/community harm.
- **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**: Trains in values-based conflict transformation.
- **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**: Supports Indigenous justice systems in BAZs.
- **Mental Health Governance Framework**: Supports Crisis Sanctuaries and Harm Reduction Teams.
- **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**: Ensures neurodiversity and accessibility.
- **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework**: Coordinates local efforts in emergencies.
- **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**: Guides protocols for intimate partner violence.
- **Youth & Future Generations Integration Protocol**: Ensures youth participation.
- **Regenerative Enterprise Framework**: Informs reparations for organizational harm.
- **Global Mobility Passport**: Supports transient populations.

### 2. Core Principles

1. **Safety as Collective Well-being**: Safety is connection, trust, and resources for all, including neurodivergent and disabled individuals.
2. **Restorative Justice First**: Prioritizes facilitated repair over punishment.
3. **De-escalation by Default**: Unarmed specialists are first responders.
4. **No Coercive Force Covenant**: Prohibits deadly force, using non-violent resolution.
5. **Addressing Root Causes**: Tackles economic insecurity, trauma, and exclusion.
6. **Primacy of Indigenous Justice**: Indigenous systems are paramount in BAZs, with a Red Lines Clause allowing modification/rejection of framework components.
7. **Community Ownership and Accountability**: Systems are community-designed and overseen.
8. **Fractal Governance**: Enables hyper-local adaptations.
9. **Neurodiversity & Disability Justice**: Prioritizes accessibility, co-designed with the Global Disability Alliance.
10. **Intergenerational Healing**: Addresses impacts on future generations.
11. **Safeguard Against Co-optation**: Rejects implementations prioritizing state/corporate control or using restorative language to mask punitive practices.

### 9. Conclusion: Collective Care Woven, Not Waged

The Collective Care & Safety Framework transforms safety into a community-led act of relationship, repair, and inclusion. By prioritizing neurodiversity, Indigenous sovereignty, and root cause solutions, it empowers communities to weave well-being, resilient against co-optation and sustainable for care workers.

### Appendix: Community Guide

**What is the Collective Care & Safety Framework?**

This framework helps communities create safety without police or punishment. It focuses on healing, care, and fixing the root causes of harm, like poverty or mental health struggles.

- **How it Works**: Trained community members called Safety Weavers help solve conflicts peacefully. Circles bring people together to repair harm. Sanctuaries offer safe spaces for those in distress.
- **Who Runs It**: Your community, through a council chosen fairly, including youth, elders, and diverse voices.
- **Why It Matters**: It builds trust, supports everyone’s needs, and creates a stronger, more connected community.

**Get Involved**: Contact your Community Safety Council, join a Solidarity Circle, or use the Community Safety Platform to learn more or get help.
