### 1. Introduction: Weaving Collective Care from the Fabric of Community

#### The Challenge

Traditional policing models, rooted in coercion and punishment, have failed to create true safety, often escalating conflicts, traumatizing individuals, and ignoring root causes like poverty, mental health crises, neurodiversity needs, and social alienation. This leaves a gap for a system that fosters healing, inclusion, and resilience rather than punishment.

#### The Opportunity

The Collective Care & Safety Framework (Restorative Community Safety) equips communities, particularly within Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), to create safety systems grounded in restorative justice, de-escalation, and mutual care. It shifts from reactive, force-based responses to proactively addressing harm’s root causes, ensuring neurodiversity and disability justice are central. Trained specialists mediate conflicts, connect people to support, and facilitate healing, making safety a collective, inclusive achievement.

#### Systemic Position

This framework is a core Tier 2 application, serving as the GGF’s frontline, community-level justice and safety system. It operates in a nested relationship with other frameworks:

- **Justice Systems Framework**: Handles harms restoratively at the local level. Escalation to the Healing Justice Tribunal occurs only when restorative processes fail, are refused, or for severe harms as defined by the community.
- **Shield & Aegis Protocols**: Address systemic threats (e.g., transnational crime, military conflict). This framework manages interpersonal and community-level harm, preventing unnecessary escalation.
- **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**: Trains community members in values-based conflict transformation.
- **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**: In BAZs, this framework’s tools support, but are subordinate to, sovereign Indigenous justice systems.
- **Mental Health Governance Framework**: Provides tools and support systems for Harm Reduction Teams and Crisis Sanctuaries.
- **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**: Ensures neurodiversity and disability inclusion in all training and operations.

### 2. Core Principles

1. **Safety as Collective Well-being**: Safety is the presence of connection, trust, and resources for all to thrive, including neurodivergent and disabled individuals, not merely the absence of crime.
2. **Restorative Justice First**: The primary response to harm is a facilitated process addressing the needs of the harmed, the person causing harm, and the community, prioritizing repair over punishment.
3. **De-escalation by Default**: Unarmed specialists trained in mediation, de-escalation, and trauma-informed care are first responders. Coercive force is an absolute last resort.
4. **No Coercive Force Covenant**: The framework prohibits deadly force, prioritizing non-violent resolution and temporary community-held safe spaces for extreme cases.
5. **Addressing Root Causes**: Safety stems from tackling economic insecurity, trauma, mental health challenges, neurodiversity needs, and lack of belonging.
6. **Primacy of Indigenous Justice**: In sovereign BAZs, Indigenous justice systems are paramount. This framework offers resources, not directives.
7. **Community Ownership and Accountability**: Safety systems are designed, staffed, and overseen by communities, ensuring cultural resonance and accountability.
8. **Fractal Governance**: Hyper-local adaptations within BAZs allow neighborhoods to tailor the framework to their unique needs.
9. **Neurodiversity & Disability Justice**: All processes and training prioritize accessibility and inclusion, co-designed with the Global Disability Alliance.

### 3. Structural Components & GGF Integration

#### 3.1. Governance: The Community Safety Council

- **Mandate**: Oversees the local Collective Care & Safety system, setting priorities, managing resources, and ensuring accountability.
- **Composition**: Community members selected via sortition, with reserved seats for elders, youth, marginalized groups, and neurodivergent/disabled representatives. In BAZs, the council integrates with or is subordinate to Indigenous governance.
- **Powers**:
  - Hires and oversees Community Safety Weavers, Harm Reduction & Support Teams, and Crisis Sanctuary staff.
  - Manages budgets from the Global Commons Fund (mechanism_gcf).
  - Defines the local Harm Escalation Protocol.

#### 3.2. Operational Teams: The Pillars of Collective Care

- **Community Safety Weavers**:
  - **Role**: Unarmed first responders and peacekeepers trained in de-escalation, mediation, conflict transformation, trauma-informed care, somatic healing, neurodiversity inclusion, and cross-cultural mediation (co-developed with the Earth Council and Cultural Heritage Framework).
  - **Function**: Respond to non-emergency disputes, welfare checks, and disturbances, facilitating mediation. Training is co-designed with the Global Disability Alliance for accessibility.
  - **GGF Integration**: Recognized under the Work in Liberation Framework, rewarded with Hearts on the Love Ledger.

    **Example Vignette**: *A Safety Weaver responds to a heated argument at a community market. Using non-violent communication, they de-escalate tensions between two vendors, facilitate a mediated agreement, and connect one vendor to mental health support, preventing further conflict.*

- **Harm Reduction & Support Teams**:
  - **Role**: Specialists connecting individuals to resources addressing harm’s root causes, trained in trauma-informed care, somatic healing, and neurodiversity inclusion.
  - **Function**: Provide case management and warm hand-offs to mental health, housing, addiction support, and economic security services.
  - **GGF Integration**: Link the “Addressing Root Causes” principle to GGF’s social support systems.
- **Restorative Justice Circles**:
  - **Role**: Community-led processes addressing harm post-occurrence.
  - **Function**: Facilitators convene circles to understand impacts, address needs, and plan repair/reintegration, with access to GCF resources for material reparations.
  - **GGF Integration**: Primary justice mechanism, with outcomes logged on a local Love Ledger.
- **Solidarity Circles**:
  - **Role**: Proactive pods addressing systemic biases and emergent conflicts before harm occurs.
  - **Function**: Small, affinity-based groups for mutual aid and early intervention, applying Peace Framework principles.
  - **GGF Integration**: Recognized as community care work, eligible for Hearts rewards.
- **Accountability Pods**:
  - **Role**: Intensive restorative process for high-harm or repeat-harm cases before escalation.
  - **Function**: Rotating teams trained in transformative justice facilitate extended processes for complex cases.
  - **GGF Integration**: Final restorative step before escalation to the Digital Justice Tribunal.

#### 3.3. Key Infrastructure & Protocols

- **Crisis Sanctuaries**:
  - **Role**: Non-carceral, 24/7 spaces for people in acute distress (e.g., psychosis, suicidal ideation, neurodivergent sensory overload), staffed by peers and healers.
  - **Function**: Co-governed by the Community Safety Council and Mental Health Governance Framework, ensuring disability justice.
  - **GGF Integration**: Joint venture with the Mental Health Governance Framework.
- **Community Safety Platform**:
  - **Role**: Multi-lingual app/phone line for non-emergency support requests.
  - **Function**: AI/algorithmic triage undergoes continuous, open-source bias audits by the GGF’s Office of Algorithmic Accountability (per TGIF and Aurora Accord).
- **De-escalation Protocol**: Standard procedure for Safety Weavers, emphasizing non-violent communication, empathy, and resolution space, inclusive of neurodivergent needs.
- **Harm Escalation Protocol**:
  - **Role**: Community-defined protocol specifying harms requiring escalation to the Healing Justice Tribunal or Shield Protocol.
  - **Function**: Accountability Pods serve as an intermediate step for complex cases.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Restorative Circle**: Interpersonal conflicts, property damage, theft, minor assaults where responsibility is taken.
    - **Accountability Pod**: Patterns of harm, severe assaults, or insufficient initial restorative outcomes.
    - **Healing Justice Tribunal**: Severe harms (e.g., murder, sexual violence, organized exploitation) or ongoing threats with refusal of restorative engagement.

### 4. Economic Model & GGF Integration

- **Funding**: Primarily funded by the mechanism_gcf (Global Commons Fund), allocated by the Community Safety Council, treating safety as a public good.
- **Community Safety Bonds**: Financial tool within the Financial Systems Framework, enabling municipalities to divest from carceral budgets and invest in the GCF, with funds earmarked for community safety initiatives.
- **AUBI & Hearts Integration (framework_aubi)**:
  - AUBI Layer 1 provides universal baseline income, preventing crimes of desperation and ensuring stability for care workers.
  - AUBI Layer 2 (Hearts rewards) provides additional income for Community Safety Weavers, Restorative Justice Facilitators, and Solidarity Circle participants, creating a regenerative economic loop valuing care work.
  - **GGF Integration**: Combines baseline security with recognition of community care via the Love Ledger.
- **Reparative Justice Fund**: Restorative Justice Circles access GCF resources for material reparations (e.g., housing, land access).

### 5. Measuring Regenerative Safety

- **Metrics**:
  - **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Tracks collective efficacy (% of conflicts resolved restoratively), material well-being (housing stability, food security), and joy indicators (community festivals, shared meals).
  - **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**: Measures environmental well-being at the BAZ level.
- **Community Well-being Dashboard**:
  - Public-facing, real-time tool tracking “conflicts resolved restoratively,” “access to support services,” and “days since last escalation to formal justice.”
  - **GGF Integration**: Aligns with the Aurora Accord’s transparency principles.

### 6. Implementation Pathway

- **Phase 1: Seeding & Training (Years 1-2)**:
  - Launch emergent pilots in 3-5 diverse BAZs/municipalities, encouraging guerrilla prototypes (e.g., single Crisis Sanctuary).
  - Establish training academies for Community Safety Weavers, integrating Peace Framework, Indigenous knowledge keepers, and Global Disability Alliance standards.
  - Develop the open-source Community Safety Platform.
- **Phase 2: Scaling & Integration (Years 3-5)**:
  - Expand to more communities, creating regional support hubs.
  - Integrate Harm Escalation Protocol with the Justice Systems Framework.
  - Build evidence via LMCI and BHI shifts.
- **Phase 3: Global Standard (Years 6+)**:
  - Establish the framework as the GGF-supported default for local safety.
  - Create a global practitioner network via the framework_digital_commons.
- **Cultural Adaptation & High-Risk Contexts**:
  - Uses a “core + module” approach: universal principles with community-adapted practices.
  - In high-risk contexts (e.g., authoritarian regimes), the Emergent Governance Protocol (EGP) enables grassroots adoption of tools like Solidarity Circles or de-escalation tactics without formal state approval.
