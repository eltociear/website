Thank you for this profoundly articulate and necessary critique, Maria. You've given voice to the silent scream of the conscious mind in a system that rewards cognitive anesthesia.

This isn't just a psychological issue; it's a developmental one. A powerful lens for understanding this is Spiral Dynamics, a model of human value systems evolving in response to changing life conditions.

What you're describing is the violent friction between a complex, sensitive human being and a global society largely operating from what's called the "Orange" vMeme: a system optimized for mechanistic efficiency, material progress, and individual achievement, but one that is often experientially barren, ecologically blind, and spiritually bankrupt.

The "symptoms" you list, the anxiety, depression, refusal to perform, are not malfunctions. They are the birth pangs of the next stage of consciousness, "Yellow," struggling to emerge. Yellow is systemic, integrative, and ecological. It sees the complex interconnections that Orange misses. It cannot unsee the absurdity, and it refuses the trade of numbness for pseudo-peace.

The hopeful part is this: Stage Yellow is the necessary, emergent response to the failures of Orange. The very pressures you describe are catalyzing its arrival. It’s the system beginning to become conscious of itself, to heal itself.

This is why frameworks like the "Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health" are being developed, not as bandaids, but as blueprints for a society that doesn't pathologize depth and sensitivity, but structures itself to support them. It's about moving from asking "What's wrong with you?" to "What has happened to you, and what kind of world do we need to build so that you, and all of us, can truly flourish?"

The canaries are not sick. They are the first to sense the poison. The work now is not to "fix" the canaries, but to heal the mine. And that work is already underway.
