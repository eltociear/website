## **Executive Summary**
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being within the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) ecosystem. Fully integrated with the Golden Triangle (**Treaty**, **Meta-Governance**, **Indigenous Framework**), **Work in Liberation**, **Peace & Conflict Resolution**, **Educational Systems**, and **Synoptic Protocol**, it aligns mental health with planetary health, Indigenous sovereignty, regenerative economics, and epistemic resilience. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins**: Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with ≥5% budget allocation, pilot community-led task forces in 3-5 diverse regions, and leverage the **Planetary Health Council (PHC)** for oversight.
- **Long-Term Shifts**: Transition to rights-based care, fund initiatives via the **AUBI/Hearts** system, embed mental health in climate, work, education, and epistemic policies, with metrics feeding into the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**).
- **Monitoring & Accountability**: Use **Psychosocial Flourishing Metrics** as inputs to the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**, with community-led monitoring and transparency via the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.

---

## **Quick Start Guide**
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC**: Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets, enforced via the **Treaty**’s Pillar 3 (**Digital Justice Tribunal**) with a **Path to Compliance Checklist** (policy reform, training, budget increase).
2. **Pilot Community-Led Task Forces**: Launch in 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., urban Africa, rural Asia, Indigenous Americas) with **Cultural Adaptation Toolkit** and **FPIC 2.0** consent for Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).
3. **Leverage Planetary Health Council (PHC)**: Oversee mental health governance with a **Traffic Light System** (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) and performance benchmarks (e.g., 80% access to care, 50% stigma reduction).

---

## **Principles in Practice Sidebar**
- **Case Example 1 (Kenya)**: Community-led task forces with traditional healers reduced stigma by 30% (2023 pilot data).
- **Case Example 2 (Netherlands)**: Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Lab improved depression outcomes by 25% under academic oversight (2024 study).
- **Case Example 3 (New Zealand)**: Rights-based care eliminated involuntary hospitalizations, increasing patient trust by 40% (2022 survey).
- **Case Example 4 (India)**: Clinical decision trees for spiritual crises reduced misdiagnosis by 20% in pilot clinics (2024 trial).
- **Case Example 5 (Brazil)**: Awe-based therapy training improved provider empathy by 15% in urban clinics (2025 pilot).

## **1. Vision & Guiding Principles**
- **Vision**: Mental health as a transcultural human right, fostering psychosocial flourishing through human-planetary interdependence, aligned with the GGF’s commitment to ecological, cultural, and epistemic integrity.
- **Core Principles**:
  - **Transcultural Human Right**: Recognize mental health universally with **Cultural Adaptation Toolkit** (step-by-step process, competency assessments, community validation, diverse cultural examples).
  - **Equity & Neurodiversity Celebration**: Prioritize marginalized groups with **inclusion metrics** (e.g., 30% representation in governance, 90% access equity).
  - **Community Participation**: Include "experts-by-experience" via **co-design workshops** with **standardized facilitation guides**, aligned with **Meta-Governance** principles.
  - **Holistic & Ecopsychological Care**: Link mental health with planetary health, contributing to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
  - **Care Ethics**: Emphasize relational well-being, guided by the **Moral Operating System (MOS)**.
  - **Existential Grounding**: Address meaning, mortality, and isolation with **Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy** and **clinical decision trees** (e.g., spiritual crises vs. psychosis, with examples from African, Asian, and Indigenous contexts).
  - **Right to Consciousness-Inclusive Healing**: Provide **standardized safety protocols** with **clinical decision trees** (e.g., distinguishing mystical experiences from pathology).
  - **Psychosocial Flourishing Metrics**: Track social connectedness, meaning, and self-efficacy via validated surveys (e.g., WHO-5 Well-Being Index, Social Connectedness Scale) as inputs to the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**.
  - **Mysticism ≠ Pathology**: Recognize awe, grief, and joy as healing modalities with **clinical guidelines** and **provider training modules** (e.g., case studies on awe-based therapy in Brazil, India, and Australia).
  - **Psychosocial Sovereignty**: Communities’ right to self-govern mental health narratives, supported by **community-led policy templates** and **FPIC 2.0** for BAZs.
- **Our Guiding Philosophy: Nurturing Conditions for Flourishing**: This framework operates on the understanding that human behavior and well-being are emergent properties of complex, interdependent systems—biological, social, economic, and ecological. Our goal is not to 'fix' individuals but to nurture the conditions within these systems that allow psychosocial flourishing to arise naturally.
