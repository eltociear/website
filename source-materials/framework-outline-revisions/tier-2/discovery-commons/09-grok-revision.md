# The Discovery Commons (Version 0.4)

### A GGF Framework for Scientific & Research Integrity

*This is an updated draft (Version 0.4) for a Tier 2 GGF framework, governing the production of scientific knowledge as a global public good. It ensures knowledge is ethical, open, and directed toward planetary well-being, with radical equity, decolonized structures, crisis responsiveness, and adaptive governance. The Discovery Commons acts as the living library and research lab for a planetary civilization, evolving through global community feedback.*

### **1. Introduction: The Engine of Verifiable Knowledge**

#### **The Challenge**

The polycrisis is an epistemic crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine apartheid saw life-saving knowledge hoarded by wealthy nations and corporations, delaying global recovery and costing millions of lives. Fragmented, privatized scientific systems slow innovation, hinder collaboration on existential threats, and erode public trust. Historical inequities, including the extraction of Global South and Indigenous knowledge, exacerbate these issues, risking misaligned priorities and privatized insights.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Discovery Commons reimagines scientific research as a transparent, collaborative, and decolonized enterprise for human and planetary flourishing. It directs public funding toward critical challenges, dismantles power and data silos, and ensures knowledge is a shared, equitable inheritance. As the GGF’s engine for verifiable, open-access knowledge, it underpins governance, education, and media integrity, fostering a wiser future.

#### **Alignment with the Global Open Science Movement**

The Discovery Commons partners with initiatives like UNESCO’s Open Science Partnership and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), aligning with FAIR data principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability). It leverages networks like SCOSS to coordinate funding and infrastructure across 340+ institutions, amplifying global efforts.

#### **The Framework**

As a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework**, The Discovery Commons governs the lifecycle of publicly funded research—from priority-setting and funding to methodology, publication, and intellectual property. It integrates with **The Capacity Engine** (disseminating findings), the **Synoptic Protocol** (relying on rigor), the **Digital Commons** (hosting outputs), and the **Disaster Risk Reduction Framework** (`framework_drr`) for crisis responsiveness.

### **2. Core Principles**

- **Knowledge as a Public Good**: All publicly funded research outputs—data, papers, code—are a global commons, accessible in multiple languages.
- **Epistemic Rigor & Integrity**: Upholding the highest standards of methodology, open peer review, and reproducibility for trustworthy knowledge.
- **Mission-Oriented Research**: Prioritizing research addressing GGF-identified challenges, with citizen and community input.
- **Epistemological Pluralism**: Integrating diverse ways of knowing, including Indigenous methodologies, with dynamic consent and data sovereignty.
- **Ethical Conduct & Precaution**: Adhering to ethical guidelines and the precautionary principle in high-stakes domains like AI and synthetic biology.
- **Equity, Justice & Decolonization**: Centering Global South leadership and reparative funding to dismantle historical power imbalances.
- **Iterative Governance**: Evolving the framework through feedback from global epistemic communities, ensuring adaptability.

### **3. Structural Components & GGF Integration**

The Discovery Commons establishes core institutions with decentralized, equitable, and adaptive governance.

**Simplified Narrative Overview**:
- The `council_global_research` sets global priorities, guided by diverse experts and citizens.
- `institution_regional_research_hubs` adapt priorities locally, with veto power for urgent needs.
- `institution_public_research_fund` allocates equitable funding, with 20% for Global South capacity.
- `institution_global_science_assembly` ensures democratic oversight.
- Protocols ensure open access, ethical IP, Indigenous sovereignty, and crisis response.
- The `framework_digital_commons` hosts a multilingual, interoperable platform.

### **8. Conclusion: Science for the People and the Planet**

The Discovery Commons transforms science into a decolonized, collaborative, and crisis-responsive engine for planetary regeneration. By centering equity, transparency, and adaptability, it provides the GGF with verifiable truth to navigate the 21st century. We invite scientists, educators, and citizens to become stewards of this living commons, building a wiser, fairer future together.
