# The Discovery Commons (Version 0.8)

### A GGF Framework for Scientific & Research Integrity

*This is the definitive, pilot-ready draft (Version 0.8) for a Tier 2 GGF framework, governing the production of scientific knowledge as a global public good. It ensures knowledge is ethical, open, and directed toward planetary well-being, with radical equity, decolonized structures, crisis responsiveness, and adaptive governance. The Discovery Commons acts as the living library and research lab for a planetary civilization, evolving through global community feedback, fostering trust through accessible engagement, preventing capture through robust mechanisms, ensuring sustainability through economic modeling, and empowering local innovation through community-driven mechanisms.*

### **1. Introduction: The Engine of Verifiable Knowledge**

#### **The Challenge**

The polycrisis is an epistemic crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine apartheid saw life-saving knowledge hoarded by wealthy nations and corporations, delaying global recovery and costing millions of lives. Fragmented, privatized scientific systems slow innovation, hinder collaboration on existential threats, and erode public trust. Historical inequities, including the extraction of Global South and Indigenous knowledge, exacerbate these issues, risking misaligned priorities and privatized insights.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Discovery Commons reimagines scientific research as a transparent, collaborative, and decolonized enterprise for human and planetary flourishing. It directs public funding toward critical challenges, dismantles power and data silos, and ensures knowledge is a shared, equitable inheritance. As the GGF’s engine for verifiable, open-access knowledge, it underpins governance, education, and media integrity, fostering a wiser future through a **living library and research lab for a planetary civilization**.

#### **Alignment with the Global Open Science Movement**

The Discovery Commons partners with initiatives like UNESCO’s Open Science Partnership and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), aligning with FAIR data principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability). It leverages networks like SCOSS to coordinate funding and infrastructure across 340+ institutions, amplifying global efforts. Specific APIs ensure integration with platforms like PubMed, arXiv, and institutional repositories, supporting diverse publication traditions (e.g., oral, multimedia).

#### **The Framework**

As a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework**, The Discovery Commons governs the lifecycle of publicly funded research—from priority-setting and funding to methodology, publication, and intellectual property. It integrates with **The Capacity Engine** (disseminating findings), the **Synoptic Protocol** (relying on rigor), the **Digital Commons** (hosting outputs), and the **Disaster Risk Reduction Framework** (`framework_drr`) for crisis responsiveness. It aligns with existing science cooperation treaties via the `framework_treaty`, enhancing global coordination.

---

### **2. Core Principles**

- **Knowledge as a Public Good**: All publicly funded research outputs—data, papers, code—are a global commons, accessible in multiple languages.
- **Epistemic Rigor & Integrity**: Upholding the highest standards of methodology, open peer review, and reproducibility for trustworthy knowledge.
- **Mission-Oriented Research**: Prioritizing research addressing GGF-identified challenges, with citizen and community input.
- **Epistemological Pluralism**: Integrating diverse ways of knowing, including Indigenous methodologies, with dynamic consent and data sovereignty.
- **Ethical Conduct & Precaution**: Adhering to ethical guidelines and the precautionary principle in high-stakes domains like AI and synthetic biology.
- **Equity, Justice & Decolonization**: Centering Global South leadership and reparative funding to dismantle historical power imbalances.
- **Iterative Governance**: Evolving the framework through feedback from global epistemic communities, ensuring adaptability and resilience.

---

### **3. Structural Components & GGF Integration**

The Discovery Commons establishes core institutions with decentralized, equitable, and adaptive governance, designed to foster trust, scalability, and prevent capture.

**Simplified Narrative Overview**:
- The `council_global_research` sets global priorities with diverse expertise and citizen input, advised by a cultural advisory board.
- `institution_regional_research_hubs` adapt priorities locally, with veto power and culturally contextualized narratives, supported by civil society partnerships.
- `institution_public_research_fund` allocates equitable funding, prioritizing Global South capacity and grassroots researchers.
- `institution_global_science_assembly` ensures democratic oversight with override capabilities.
- Protocols enforce open access, ethical IP, Indigenous sovereignty, crisis response, and risk mitigation.
- The `framework_digital_commons` hosts a multilingual, interoperable platform with a public-facing portal and user feedback system.

### **4. Key Functions & Mandates**

1. **Setting Global Research Priorities**: Annual Global Research Agenda via GGF bodies, citizen assemblies, Community Priorities Panels, and `channel_grassroots_priorities`. Regional Hubs can veto conflicting priorities, subject to `institution_global_science_assembly` override, with culturally contextualized narratives advised by `board_global_cultural_advisory`.
2. **Allocating Public Funding Equitably**: Transparent calls weighted for Global South, with 20% via `mechanism_research_equity_fund` for infrastructure, fellowships, micro-grants, community innovation, and Moonshot Challenges.
3. **Enforcing Open Science**: Mandatory compliance, tracked by `platform_transition_observatory`. Non-compliant institutions face sanctions via `protocol_non_compliance_escalation` or lose **Discovery Commons Certified** status (`mechanism_institutional_recognition`).
4. **Stewarding Intellectual Property as a Commons**: `protocol_ethical_ip`, `protocol_planetary_commons_license`, and `protocol_ip_transition` ensure public benefit, with revenue reinvested.
5. **Adjudicating Research Misconduct**: Handled by `council_global_research`, escalated to `institution_dj_tribunal`’s **Epistemic Justice Chamber**.

#### **4.5 Economic Impact & Sustainability**
- **Global Research Investment**: Targets 5-10% of global public R&D spending initially, scaled through national quotas and `mechanism_gcf` allocations.
- **Cost-Benefit Modeling**: The `institution_public_research_fund` conducts ongoing modeling, comparing accelerated innovation gains against transition costs from traditional patent systems.
- **Free-Rider Nation Strategy**: Non-contributing nations lose access to `protocol_planetary_commons_license` benefits, face `framework_gaian_trade` restrictions, and are ineligible for `mechanism_institutional_recognition`.
- **Patent System Transition**: The `protocol_ip_transition` includes a “grandfather clause” for existing patents and incentivizes new discoveries into the commons via funding priority and Impact Credits.

#### **4.6 Stakeholder Onboarding Strategy**
- **Engagement Toolkits (`tool_engagement_toolkits`)**: Tailored resources for governments, universities, corporations, civil society, and grassroots researchers, hosted on `platform_citizen_commons_portal`.
- **Global Commons Ambassadors (`initiative_global_commons_ambassadors`)**: Co-managed by `council_global_research` and `institution_knowledge_commons_ombudsperson`, recruits scientists, educators, and community leaders (especially from Global South and Indigenous groups) to promote the framework locally.
- **Civil Society Partnership Network (`network_civil_society_partnership`)**: Formalizes partnerships with NGOs and advocacy groups to co-design priorities and disseminate findings.
