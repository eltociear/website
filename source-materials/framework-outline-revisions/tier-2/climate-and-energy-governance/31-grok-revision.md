# Climate & Energy Governance Framework

## Preamble: A Charter for Planetary Stewardship
We, the stewards of Earth, commit to a sacred covenant to restore and sustain planetary stability. Guided by justice, equity, and the wisdom of Indigenous and traditional knowledge, we pledge to recalibrate humanity’s relationship with energy—from an extractive paradigm to one of symbiotic stewardship. This framework is our collective blueprint to secure a thriving, resilient, and equitable future for all life on our only home.

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Define the need for a unified global approach to climate and energy governance, building on UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, and IPCC foundations.
- **Scope**: Address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable energy transitions, emphasizing that global energy systems account for approximately two-thirds of emissions.
- **Vision**: A resilient, equitable, and low-carbon global future, recalibrating humanity’s relationship with energy through community ownership and clean, accessible energy via Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs). This recalibration is managed through the Sundown Protocol as the key GGF tool for transitioning away from the extractive paradigm.
- **Key Definitions**:  
  - *Net-zero*: No net addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  
  - *Climate finance*: Funds for mitigation, adaptation, and loss/damage.  
  - *Clean energy*: Renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) plus nuclear, excluding fossil fuels even with CCS *unless independently verified to deliver net-negative outcomes at scale*.

## 2. Guiding Principles
- **Sustainability**: Prioritize long-term ecological balance and resource preservation, integrating *circular economy principles* (e.g., reduce, reuse, recycle) aligned with biodiversity protection under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
- **Equity**: Ensure fair distribution of responsibilities and benefits across nations, communities, and genders.  
  - **Sub-principle**: *Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)*—developed nations lead emissions cuts based on historical responsibility, with policies addressing gendered climate impacts.
- **Science-Based Decision Making**: Ground policies in IPCC research and UNFCCC mechanisms.
- **Cooperation**: Foster international collaboration and accountability, leveraging Paris Agreement frameworks.
- **Adaptability**: Build flexibility to respond to evolving challenges, technologies, and political shifts.
- **Community Energy Sovereignty**: Promote 80% community-owned renewable energy systems to empower local stakeholders, framed as an application of the *Hearthstone Protocol*.
- **Ethical Framework**:  
  - *Equity, reparations, intergenerational responsibility, and Indigenous rights as ethical imperatives guiding all actions.*

## 3. Governance Structure
- **Global Oversight Body**
  - Role: Coordinate policies, monitor progress, and enforce agreements; *integrates with UNFCCC processes and enhances Paris Agreement enforcement*.  
  - Enforcement Tools: Trade penalties, climate tariffs, and restricted access to green tech funds; *align trade measures with WTO exemptions (GATT Article XX)*.  
  - Dispute Resolution: *International Climate Tribunal*, a specialized chamber within the GGF’s *Digital Justice Tribunal*, starting as an advisory/soft-law body linked to UNFCCC arbitration, evolving as consensus builds.  
  - *Climate Emergency Clause*: Authority to invoke emergency powers, triggered by the *Planetary Health Council* when specific *Biosphere Health Index (BHI)* thresholds are breached, such as:  
    - *+1.5°C global average for 12 consecutive months*  
    - *Methane release >50 Gt CO2e annually*  
    - *Critical BHI ecological indicator breaches (e.g., Amazon tipping point reached)*  
  - *Safeguards*: Independent audits and rotating leadership to prevent capture by powerful interests.
- **Regional Hubs**
  - Role: Tailor global goals to regional contexts (e.g., Africa, Asia-Pacific, Americas), coordinating with subnational actors (cities, regions).
  - Focus: Local capacity building, resource allocation, and resilience to political backsliding (e.g., multi-stakeholder coalitions).
- **National Implementation Units**
  - Role: Execute policies and report progress, aligned with Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
  - Emphasis: Sovereignty respected, with *fallback mechanisms* (e.g., regional oversight) during national political shifts.
- **Governance of Emerging Energy Technologies**
  - Any research, piloting, or deployment of high-stakes emerging technologies like nuclear fusion, advanced geothermal, direct air capture at scale, and solar radiation management (geoengineering) is subject to:
    - Oversight by the *council_gtc (Global Technology Council)*.
    - A mandatory *Seven-Generation Impact Assessment*, with veto power held by the *institution_gya (Global Youth Assembly)*, as defined in the Youth & Future Generations framework.
    - *FPIC 2.0* consent from Indigenous communities for any projects that could have bioregional or planetary impact, overseen by the *council_earth*.

## 4. Core Pillars of Climate & Energy Transformation
- **Pillar I: Radical Mitigation & Ecosystem Restoration**
  - Targets: Net-zero emissions by 2050, with interim milestones (e.g., 50% reduction by 2035).
  - Strategies: Carbon pricing, *nature-based solutions (NbS)* funded and tracked via the *AUBI Framework*’s *Leaves* currency for restoration incentives, and industrial decarbonization via circular economy practices (e.g., closed-loop manufacturing).
- **Pillar II: The Just & Sovereign Energy Transition**
  - Goal: Shift to 90-100% clean energy globally by 2050 (aligned with IPCC SR1.5 pathways), with 80% community-owned renewable energy systems.
  - Methods:  
    - Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and redirecting funds to renewable energy, linked directly to the Sundown Protocol's *mechanism_legacy_transition_fund* and its Reparations Levy, framing it as the financial engine for this redirection of capital.  
    - Grid modernization for decentralized, resilient energy systems.  
    - Scaling *Community Energy Cooperatives* as *Community Work Teams* under the *Work in Liberation Framework*.  
    - Just transition programs for fossil fuel workers, managed by the Sundown Protocol’s *institution_office_just_transition*, including retraining and economic diversification.  
    - *Community Energy Sovereignty* framed as an application of the *Hearthstone Protocol*, transitioning local energy infrastructure into commons-stewarded assets.  
    - Sustainable supply chains for renewable energy technologies (e.g., ethical sourcing of critical minerals).  
    - Circular energy systems (e.g., battery recycling, modular solar panel designs).
- **Pillar III: Traditional Knowledge-led Adaptation & Resilience**
  - Focus: Resilience for vulnerable populations and ecosystems, guided by Indigenous and local knowledge, operationally managed by the *Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (DRR)*.
  - Actions: Infrastructure upgrades, disaster preparedness, *NbS* (e.g., mangrove restoration) aligned with Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework targets, and climate finance for developing nations.
- **Pillar IV: Building the Regenerative Energy Commons**
  - **The Narrative:** Actively promoting the vision of community-owned, resilient, and abundant clean energy, managed by the *framework_synoptic* and *institution_gimn* to counter disinformation.
  - **The Lived Experience:** Highlighting how *Community Energy Cooperatives*, integrated with the *framework_aubi*, not only provide clean power but also create local wealth, strengthen community bonds (increasing the *LMCI*), and improve quality of life.
  - **The Economic Advantage:** Detailing how the *Regenerative Trade Zone (RTZ)* creates a powerful economic incentive for nations to join the transition, leveraging the "pull effect" described in Appendix C.

## 5. Policy Mechanisms
- **Legislation**: Binding treaties enhancing Paris Agreement commitments, with clear enforcement.
- **Economic Tools**: Global carbon markets, green bonds, and subsidies for clean tech and circular systems.
- **Monitoring & Reporting**: Annual transparency reports aligned with UNFCCC standards; *Mandatory Corporate Climate Disclosure* per ISSB.
- **Sanctions & Incentives**: Penalties for non-compliance (e.g., barring companies from public contracts); rewards for exceeding targets.
- **Just Transition Compacts**: Require fossil fuel companies to support workers, linked to sanctions. These compacts are legally defined by the Sundown Protocol's *protocol_worker_community_protection*, which guarantees income, housing, healthcare, and retraining, and is enforceable by the *institution_dj_tribunal*.

## 6. Stakeholder Engagement
- **Governments**: Lead policy adoption, integrating with UNFCCC and national frameworks.
- **Private Sector**: Drive innovation and compliance (e.g., disclosures, compacts).
- **Civil Society**: Advocate for marginalized groups (Indigenous, women, youth).  
  - *Condition*: Indigenous/local veto power over energy projects to prevent green colonialism.  
  - *Example*: Sámi opposition to wind farms in Scandinavia.  
  - *Education Mandate*: Implement climate education, awareness campaigns, and youth programs via *Youth Ambassadors* and *Peer Learning Networks* on the *Digital Commons* to share success stories and build momentum.

  - *Cities Coalition*: Network of urban governments with formal representation in implementation bodies.
  - *Institutional Innovations*: Grant formal status to non-state coalitions in thematic working groups.
- **Scientific Community**: Provide IPCC-aligned data and solutions.

## 7. Financing the Framework
- **Sources**: Multilateral funds (e.g., Green Climate Fund), private capital, national contributions.  
  - *Reparative Contributions*: High-emission nations commit 0.5-1% of GDP, supplemented by a *Climate Capacity Index* (equity-adjusted measure).
- **Allocation**:  
  - *Mitigation & Adaptation*: Prioritize developing nations and high-impact projects.  
  - *Loss and Damage*: Distinct fund (e.g., $100B/year by 2030), separate from adaptation.
- **Scale**: $500 billion annually by 2030, scaling to $1 trillion by 2040.

## 8. Milestone-Driven Roadmap with Target Timeframes
- **Milestone 1: Governance Activation** (Target: 18 months)  
  - *Trigger*: Formal establishment of the *Global Oversight Body* and ratification of the framework by the initial *Regenerative Trade Zone (RTZ)* coalition (e.g., 15+ nations/BAZs).
- **Milestone 2: Economic Engine Online** (Target: Year 3)  
  - *Trigger*: The *International Climate Tribunal* (as a chamber of the *Digital Justice Tribunal*) is operational, and the *Reparative Contributions* funding mechanism is capitalized and making its first disbursements.
- **Milestone 3: Systemic Shift** (Target: Year 8)  
  - *Trigger*: The *Biosphere Health Index (BHI)* officially supplants GDP in public reporting within all RTZ member states, and 50% of the RTZ’s energy is community-owned.
- **Milestone 4: Global Tipping Point** (Target: Year 15)  
  - *Trigger*: The RTZ encompasses over 60% of the global economy, making its trade and climate standards the de facto global norm and achieving the 90-100% clean energy goal internally.

## 9. Metrics for Success
