# **The Cairn Protocol v2.0**

**Subtitle:** A Framework for Addiction, Recovery, and Substance Sovereignty  
**Tagline:** Marking the Path from Harm to Healing  
**Tier:** 2 (Foundational Application Layer)  
**Status:** Final Draft  
**Implementation Priority:** High  

---

### **1. Introduction: Finding the Way Home**

#### **The Challenge**

The global polycrisis of addiction—encompassing substances (opioids, alcohol), digital dependencies (social media, gaming), and behavioral compulsions (gambling, shopping)—requires a transformative response. Current systems often fail: carceral approaches criminalize health issues, deepening trauma, while clinical models pathologize individuals, overlooking root causes like economic despair, social isolation, intergenerational trauma, and corporate-driven addictive designs.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Cairn Protocol offers a **"Third Way"** grounded in **Reparative Justice**, moving beyond punishment and pathology to a community-led, health-centered ecosystem. It emphasizes harm reduction, tackles systemic drivers, and upholds the sovereignty of individuals and communities to chart their healing paths. Recovery is a collective journey, supported by a robust infrastructure of care.

#### **The Declaration of Substance Sovereignty**  
This charter, aligned with the Planetary Health Charter, asserts:  
- The right to bodily autonomy and informed consent in substance use and recovery.  
- The freedom to access sacred plant medicines under Indigenous governance.  
- Protection from predatory, addictive-by-design products and technologies.  
This declaration serves as a moral and legal cornerstone, invocable in Digital Justice Tribunal cases.

#### **Systemic Position**

The Cairn Protocol integrates with GGF core systems:  
- **Primary Referral Pathway:** Receives warm hand-offs from the **Collective Care & Safety Framework** via Safety Weavers to Recovery Weavers, reframing substance issues as health concerns.  
- **Specialized Health Application:** Implements the **Mental Health Governance Framework** with addiction-specific protocols.  
- **Restorative Alternative:** Replaces the **Justice Systems Framework** for substance-related harms, reserving formal justice for severe exploitation cases.  
- **Economic Foundation:** Enabled by the **AUBI Framework** to address economic despair and the **`Hearts`** currency to reward peer support.  
- **Corporate Accountability:** Interfaces with the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** to hold corporations accountable for addictive products.  
- **Ancestral Wisdom:** Partners with the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** to protect Indigenous sovereignty over healing modalities.  
- **Digital Wellness:** Leverages the **Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF)** to combat digital addiction.

#### **User Entry Pathway**  
The journey begins with multiple entry points: self-referral, peer referral, or referral from a **Community Safety Weaver**. A **Recovery Weaver** guides individuals to a **Recovery Hub**, offering tailored support (harm reduction, peer groups, somatic practices). See the **Community Guide Appendix** for a visual flowchart.

### **2. Core Principles**

#### **2.1 Foundational Beliefs**
1. **Sovereignty & Self-Determination:** Individuals define their relationship with substances and recovery paths, free from coercion.  
2. **Addressing Root Causes:** Recovery requires tackling trauma, economic insecurity, disconnection, and lack of purpose.  
3. **Recovery in Community:** Healing thrives in peer support, mutual aid, and connection.  
4. **Neuroplasticity of Healing:** Recovery is possible at any stage of life. The human brain and nervous system can regenerate through connection, ritual, and care.

#### **2.2 Operational Ethics**
1. **Health-Centered, Not Punitive:** Addiction is a health and social issue, never criminal. The goal is healing, not control.  
2. **Harm Reduction as a Foundational Ethic:** Meet people where they are with evidence-based tools (e.g., safe supply, needle exchanges, digital wellness tools).  
3. **Corporate Accountability:** Corporations profiting from addictive products fund restorative healing.  
4. **Primacy of Indigenous Healing:** Traditional plant medicines are sovereign, protected from co-optation, and governed by Indigenous communities.

### **3. Governance Architecture**

- **The Cairn Council:** A sub-council of the **Planetary Health Council**, overseeing global addiction and recovery strategy.  
  - **Composition:** 60% members with lived experience (addiction/recovery, peer supporters, healers), plus reserved seats for Indigenous healers, youth, and Mental Health/Justice delegates.  
  - **Rotating Seats:** 2-year term limits ensure fresh perspectives and prevent centralization.  
- **BAZ-Level Recovery Hubs:** Decentralized, community-run centers offering:  
  - Harm reduction supplies and support.  
  - Peer-led groups and healing circles.  
  - Connections to mental health, housing, and work via the **Work in Liberation Framework**.  
  - **Somatic Sanctuaries:** Spaces for trauma-release practices (yoga, breathwork, ecstatic dance).  
  - **Neighborhood Apothecaries:** Community gardens for non-addictive plant allies (e.g., chamomile, tulsi).  
  - **Recovery Commons Charters:** Each hub adapts the framework to local needs via the **Emergent Governance Protocol** (`sense` → `propose` → `adopt`).  
  - **Joy Labs:** Host dopamine-rich activities (e.g., mural painting, karaoke) to foster non-chemical euphoria.  
- **Global Recovery Weavers Network:** Hosted on the **Digital Commons**, this network facilitates cross-BAZ sharing of best practices, grief rituals, and healing modalities, stewarded by the **Cairn Council**.

### **4. Key Mechanisms & Policies**

- **Recovery Weavers:** Trained community members with lived experience providing outreach, crisis support, and healing circle facilitation. Rewarded with **`Hearts`** via the **Love Ledger**.  
- **The Grief Feedback Pathway:** Community-led rituals, storytelling, and memorials within Recovery Hubs to process addiction-related loss, guided by the **Cultural Heritage Framework**.  
  - **Collective Grief to Grace Ratio:** Tracks rituals held vs. overdoses to measure cultural healing capacity, shared with **The Memorial Commons**.  
- **The Corporate Accountability Protocol:** Interfaces with the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework**.  
  - **Corporate Harm Levy:** Taxes profits of addictive product creators (pharma, social media, gambling, alcohol/tobacco) to fund the **Global Commons Fund**.  
  - **Addiction Impact Bonds:** Corporations fund Recovery Hubs directly; returns tied to success metrics (e.g., reduced overdoses), defined in the **Financial Systems Framework**.  
  - **Design Justice Tribunals:** A chamber of the **Digital Justice Tribunal** adjudicating predatory product designs, requiring CEOs to face community testimonials and redesign products publicly. Panels include reserved seats for **certified trauma-informed designers and practitioners**, with ethical UX guidelines co-developed by **TGIF** and the **Global Disability Alliance**.  
- **Sacred Plant Medicine Protocol:** Partnered with the **Earth Council**, ensures Indigenous governance of plant medicines (e.g., Ayahuasca, Psilocybin). Prohibits corporate patenting and ensures reciprocal benefits to Indigenous communities.  
- **Digital Sobriety & Wellness Toolkit:** Developed under **TGIF**, includes:  
  - Open APIs for user-controlled feeds.  
  - Bans on manipulative design (e.g., infinite scroll).  
  - Community-owned, non-addictive platforms via the **Digital Commons**.  
  - **Trauma-Informed AI Peer Supporters:** Open-source, 24/7 crisis response tools, governed by the **Sanctuary Accord** and **Neuro-Ethics Review Board**.  
  - **Blockchain Recovery Milestones:** Optional, anonymous NFT-based healing markers, governed by the **Aurora Accord** for privacy.  
- **Hearts Quest:** A community co-op game within the **Digital Commons** where healing tasks (e.g., mentoring, attending circles) unlock AUBI top-ups or land access. Tracks only collective progress to avoid surveillance.  
- **Recovery Resilience Workshops:** Integrated into the **Education Framework**, these workshops simulate craving triggers and teach somatic/peer-response tactics, framed as rehearsals for healing.
