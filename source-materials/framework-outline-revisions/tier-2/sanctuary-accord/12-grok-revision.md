# The Sanctuary Accord  
**Official Name:** The Sanctuary Accord – A Framework for Metabolic Rights, Sacred Time, and Protected Space  
**Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application)  
**Parent Domain:** Mental Health & Social Resilience  
**Legal Status:** Binding civil-rights and public-health infrastructure (non-optional once ratified)

### Preamble – Foundational Principles
1. Human consciousness and the lived body are metabolically costly systems that require regular periods of low stimulation, silence, darkness, seasonal rhythm, and unmediated relation in order to maintain long-term health and resilience.  
2. Extraction of attention, time, or biophysical energy without commensurate replenishment constitutes a **depletion of metabolic capital**, producing measurable individual and public-health harms.  
3. **Cognitive diversity creates differential metabolic costs.** Neurodivergent individuals, highly sensitive persons, and those with chronic conditions often require greater sanctuary access to maintain equivalent functioning. Sanctuary rights shall therefore be **universally designed** yet **differentially accessible** according to documented metabolic need.  
4. Every human being possesses a finite, evidence-based **Daily and Weekly Metabolic Budget**. Policy under this Accord shall keep all citizens within their budgeted metabolic expenditure in the same manner as fiscal or carbon budgets.  
5. Sanctuary rights are **non-rivalrous public goods** whose exercise enhances collective wellbeing.  
6. Sanctuaries are essential civic infrastructure equivalent to clean air, water, and emergency services.

### Definitions (core – to be expanded in annex)
- **Metabolic Capital** – The finite daily and weekly capacity of a human nervous system to process information, manage stimulation, regulate emotions, make decisions, and maintain homeostasis without incurring recovery debt.  
- **Sanctuary** – A zone, time, or condition in which human beings are protected from extractive claims on their attention, time, energy, or biophysical resources and are free to exist, rest, relate, and restore without requirement of productivity, consumption, or performance.

### The Four Pillars

#### Pillar 1 – Temporal Sanctuaries: The Right to Sacred and Uncommodified Time
- Absolute Right to Disconnect – minimum 11 consecutive hours daily + full weekends; zero enforceable work contact outside designated hours  
- Collective Rest Protocols – binding quiet days and planetary sabbaths  
- Seasonal & Life-Cycle Sanctuaries – solstices, menstrual/parental/bereavement leave, coming-of-age  
- **Metabolic Debt Forgiveness Periods** – quarterly “metabolic amnesty weeks” during which accumulated acceleration debt may be healed without economic or social penalty  
- Debt-Justice Integration – interest and collections suspended during all sanctuary periods  
- Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty – non-Gregorian calendars officially recognized

#### Pillar 2 – Spatial Sanctuaries: The Right to Uncommodified Place and Unmediated Relation
- Analog-Only Zones (“Vila-vagnen Protocol”) on all public transit  
- Third Place Protection Act – every residential area guaranteed free, loitering-permitted, thermally comfortable year-round public spaces with seating, sanitation, water, heating/cooling  
  - **Right to Unproductive Presence** – no individual may be moved on or required to justify their presence through consumption or visible activity  
  - **Anti-Hostile Architecture Mandate** – prohibition of armrests, spikes, sloping benches, etc.  
  - **Sanctuary Stewardship Clause** – maintenance and gentle programming recognised as high-value Care Work compensated in Hearts  
  - Gold-tier Third Places must incorporate sensory-friendly design (controlled lighting, quiet zones, stimming-friendly furniture) by default  
- Sonic Sanctuaries & Right to Darkness  
- Children’s Sanctuary Zones (500 m commercial-free radius)  
- Climate Refuge Sanctuaries  
- Indigenous-Led Baseline Sanctuary Zones (BAZs)

#### Pillar 3 – Attention Defense Shield: The Right to Cognitive Metabolism
- Ban on Addiction Architecture (including mandatory disclosure labels)  
- Mandatory Cognitive Environmental Impact Assessments  
- Visual Silence Protocol (Clean City/Cidade Limpa standards)  
- Sanctuary-Compliant Design Standard & Public-Interest Algorithm Standard  
- Attention Reparations Fund (0.7 % micro-tax on digital-advertising revenue)

#### Pillar 4 – The Right to Slowness: Anti-Acceleration Protocols
- Right to Professional Integrity  
- Slow Infrastructure Standards  
- Anti-Hustle Labor Protections  
- Slow Cities / Slow Regions Certification

### Emergency Permeability & Pre-emption Clause (Accord-wide)
Suspension only for declared emergencies (max 14 days, renewable by legislative supermajority only) with mandatory metabolic reparations afterward. “Economic competitiveness” is explicitly not an emergency.

### Right of Return for Exiles of Acceleration
Affirmative, priority access to sanctuary housing, supplemental Hearts income, and supported metabolic recovery for anyone with documented chronic depletion caused by extractive systems.

### Implementation Layer
- Sanctuary Certification System (Bronze–Silver–Gold) with **The Sanctuary Sigil**  
- Independent Sanctuary Authority with surprise audit powers  
- Violation Response Protocols including **Right of Private Action** and **Metabolic Harm Torts**  
- Phased global rollout 2026 → 2035+ with pilot cities and baseline metabolic health surveys  
- Financing via Attention Reparations Fund + luxury-extraction tax

### Cross-Framework Links
- Cognitive Sovereignty: the metabolic oxygen for thought  
- AUBI/Hearts: funds stewards and Right of Return; makes sanctuary a universal commons, not a privilege  
- Planetary Health: shared silence, darkness, and rhythm with the more-than-human world
