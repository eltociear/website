# The Sanctuary Accord  
**Official Name:** The Sanctuary Accord – A Framework for Metabolic Rights, Sacred Time, and Protected Space  
**Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application)  
**Parent Domain:** Mental Health & Social Resilience  
**Legal Status:** Binding civil-rights and public-health infrastructure (non-optional once ratified)

### Preamble – Foundational Principles
1. Human consciousness and the lived body are metabolically costly systems that require regular periods of low stimulation, silence, darkness, seasonal rhythm, and unmediated social/more-than-human relation in order to maintain long-term health and resilience.  
2. Extraction of attention, time, or biophysical energy without commensurate replenishment constitutes a **depletion of metabolic capital**, producing measurable individual and public-health harms.  
3. Every human being possesses a finite, evidence-based **Daily and Weekly Metabolic Budget**. Population-level policy under this Accord shall be designed to keep all citizens within their budgeted metabolic expenditure in the same way fiscal or carbon budgets are managed.  
4. Sanctuary rights are **non-rivalrous public goods**: their exercise enhances collective wellbeing and imposes no unavoidable cost on others.  
5. Sanctuaries are essential civic infrastructure equivalent to clean air, water, and emergency services.

### The Four Pillars

#### Pillar 1 – Temporal Sanctuaries: The Right to Sacred and Uncommodified Time
- Absolute Right to Disconnect (11 consecutive hours daily + full weekends; zero enforceable work contact)  
- Collective Rest Protocols (municipal/regional quiet days and planetary sabbaths)  
- Seasonal & Life-Cycle Sanctuaries (solstice observances, menstrual/parental/bereavement leave, coming-of-age)  
- Debt-Justice Integration (interest and collections suspended during sanctuary periods)  
- Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty (non-Gregorian calendars officially recognized)

#### Pillar 2 – Spatial Sanctuaries: The Right to Uncommodified Place and Unmediated Relation
- Analog-Only Zones (“Vila-vagnen Protocol”) on all public transit  
- Third Place Protection Act – every residential area guaranteed free, loitering-permitted, weather-protected public spaces with seating, sanitation, water, heating/cooling  
  - **Sanctuary Stewardship Clause:** Maintenance, safety, beautification, and gentle programming of Third Places is recognised high-value Care Work compensated in Hearts (AUBI Layer 2). The primary purpose of these spaces is to enable unmediated human-to-human and human-to-nature relation (conversation, ritual, play, ceremony, grief, celebration).  
- Sonic Sanctuaries & Right to Darkness  
- Children’s Sanctuary Zones (500 m commercial-free radius)  
- Climate Refuge Sanctuaries  
- Indigenous-Led Baseline Sanctuary Zones (BAZs) – maximum tier by default

#### Pillar 3 – Attention Defense Shield: The Right to Cognitive Metabolism
- Ban on Addiction Architecture  
- Mandatory Cognitive Environmental Impact Assessments  
- Visual Silence Protocol (no illuminated/moving digital advertising in public rights-of-way; Clean City/Cidade Limpa standards)  
- Sanctuary-Compliant Design Standard & Public-Interest Algorithm Standard  
- Attention Reparations Fund (0.7 % micro-tax on digital-advertising revenue)

#### Pillar 4 – The Right to Slowness: Anti-Acceleration Protocols
- Right to Professional Integrity (refuse unsafe or unethical acceleration)  
- Slow Infrastructure Standards (binding staffing ratios, appointment durations, class sizes)  
- Anti-Hustle Labor Protections  
- Slow Cities / Slow Regions Certification

### Emergency Permeability & Pre-emption Clause (Accord-wide)
- Sanctuary boundaries remain permeable only to **Tier 1 Life-Safety Alerts**.  
- No suspension of sanctuary rights is permitted for reasons of “economic competitiveness,” “national security convenience,” or “market urgency.”  
- Suspension is allowed only during a formally declared state of emergency, for a maximum of 14 days, renewable solely by legislative supermajority, and triggers mandatory metabolic reparations afterward.

### Right of Return for Exiles of Acceleration
Any person able to demonstrate chronic depletion of metabolic capital caused by extractive systems (documented burnout, long-covid, neurodivergent exclusion, etc.) possesses an affirmative **Right of Return**: priority access to housing in a certified sanctuary neighbourhood, supplemental Hearts income, and supported re-entry into protected time/space until their metabolic budget is restored.

### Implementation Layer
1. **Sanctuary Certification System** (Bronze–Silver–Gold) administered by the independent Sanctuary Authority  
   - Visual identifier: **The Sanctuary Sigil**  
2. **Violation Response Protocols** including Right of Private Action  
3. **Transition Support & Financing** via Attention Reparations Fund + luxury-extraction tax  
4. **Phased Implementation Roadmap** (2026–2029 → 2030–2035 → 2035+)

### Cross-Framework Links
- Cognitive Sovereignty: “The Sanctuary Accord is the metabolic oxygen required for cognitive sovereignty to exist in practice.”  
- AUBI/Hearts Economy: funds Sanctuary Stewards and the Right of Return; makes rest universal.  
- Planetary Health & Planetary Frameworks: shared silence, darkness, and rhythm between human and more-than-human worlds.

This is now the locked, Architect-approved final outline—constitution-grade, politically antifragile, and fully interoperable with the rest of the system.
