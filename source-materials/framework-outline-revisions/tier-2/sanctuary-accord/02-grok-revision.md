# Revised Framework: The Sanctuary Accord  
**Full Name:** The Sanctuary Accord – A Framework for Metabolic Rights and Sacred Time/Space  
**Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application)  
**Parent Domain:** Mental Health & Social Resilience  
**Core Mandate:** To defend the **metabolic integrity of human consciousness** and the **ecological integrity of lived experience** by establishing legally protected zones of non-extraction, non-interruption, and non-acceleration in time and space.

### Foundational Principles (new preamble)
- Human consciousness is a living, metabolically costly process that requires periods of low stimulation, slowness, darkness, silence, and social nutrient density to remain healthy.
- Extraction of attention, time, or biophysical energy without replenishment is a form of metabolic violence.
- Sanctuaries are not luxuries; they are public-health and civil-rights infrastructure.

### The Four Pillars (expanded from three)

#### Pillar 1: Temporal Sanctuaries – The Right to Sacred & Uncommodified Time
- Absolute Right to Disconnect: legally enforceable non-contact periods (evenings, weekends, sabbaths, seasonal cycles)
- Collective Rest Protocols: municipality- or region-wide “quiet hours/days” with critical-infrastructure down-cycling plans
- Seasonal & Life-Cycle Sanctuaries: protected cultural, ecological, and biological rhythms (solstice observances, menstrual leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, coming-of-age periods)
- Debt Justice Integration: no debt-collection activity permitted during designated sanctuary time; interest pauses during collective rest periods
- Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty: recognition of non-Gregorian calendrical systems in scheduling and labor law

#### Pillar 2: Spatial Sanctuaries – The Right to Uncommodified Place
- Analog-Only Zones (“Vila-vagnen Protocol” expanded): mandatory quiet/analog cars on all public transit; silence cars on long-distance trains
- Third Place Protection Act: zoning and tax policy guaranteeing free, loitering-permitted, non-commercial public spaces in every neighborhood
- Sonic Sanctuaries: enforceable decibel limits in residential zones and nature areas; “silence preservation easements”
- Right to Darkness: light-pollution standards and “dark-sky sanctuary” designations (urban and rural)
- Children’s Sanctuary Zones: 500 m commercial-free radius around schools, playgrounds, and childcare facilities (no advertising, no corporate sponsorship)
- Climate Refuge Sanctuaries: designated welcoming zones for climate-displaced persons with immediate right to rest and non-extraction
- Indigenous-Led Baseline Sanctuary Zones (BAZs): existing and new Cognitive Ecology Zones automatically accorded highest sanctuary protection level

#### Pillar 3: Attention Defense Shield – The Right to Cognitive Metabolism
- Ban on Addiction Architecture: prohibition of infinite scroll, auto-play, and variable-ratio reward schedules in consumer-facing digital products
- Mandatory Cognitive Environmental Impact Assessments for new developments, apps, and urban designs
- Public-Interest Algorithm Standard: any algorithm touching public money or public space must optimize for wellbeing and contemplation, not engagement
- Attention Reparations Fund: financed by a micro-tax on digital-advertising revenue; disbursed to individuals and communities demonstrably harmed by predatory attention extraction

#### Pillar 4 (new): The Right to Slowness – Anti-Acceleration Protocols
- Slow Infrastructure Standards: minimum acceptable durations for essential services (e.g., maximum patient load per nurse, maximum class size + pacing in education)
- Protection of Careful Work: legal defense for workers who refuse acceleration demands that compromise quality or safety (“right to perform the task well”)
- Anti-Hustle Labor Law: bans on “quiet quitting” discourse in workplace policy (recognized as protected speech); mandatory “slowness training” for management
- Slow Cities & Slow Regions certification with binding metrics

### Implementation Layer (new)
1. Sanctuary Certification System
   - Three tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for spaces, organizations, digital platforms, and municipalities
   - Visual marker: a simple white circle on a deep-green background

2. Violation Response Protocols
   - Tiered: Warning → Civil fine → Criminal liability for systematic breaches
   - “Sanctuary Breach” recognized as a civil-rights violation

3. Transition Support Fund
   - Paid for from the Attention Reparations Fund and a luxury-extraction tax
   - Grants to help small businesses and public transit authorities adapt to the new mandates

### Explicit Cross-Framework Links
- Cognitive Sovereignty Framework: Sanctuary zones are the physical/temporal preconditions for meaningful exercise of cognitive sovereignty
- AUBI/Hearts Economy: makes sanctuary economically viable for the entire population, not just the wealthy
- Hearthlight Protocol: Children’s Sanctuary Zones are a direct application
- Planetary Health Framework: metabolic health of ecosystems (silence, darkness, seasonal rhythm) is inseparable from human metabolic health

### Possible Final Names (for voting)
1. The Sanctuary Accord (current, strong)
2. The Metabolic Rights & Slowness Accord
3. The Sacred Time & Space Accord
4. The Right to Rest & Slowness Charter
