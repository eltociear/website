# The Sanctuary Accord  
**Official Name:** The Sanctuary Accord – A Framework for Metabolic Rights, Sacred Time, and Protected Space  
**Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application)  
**Parent Domain:** Mental Health & Social Resilience  
**Status:** Binding civil-rights and public-health infrastructure (non-optional once ratified)

### Preamble – Foundational Principles
1. Human consciousness and the lived body are metabolically costly systems that require regular periods of low stimulation, silence, darkness, seasonal rhythm, and social nutrient density in order to maintain long-term health and resilience.  
2. Extraction of attention, time, or biophysical energy without commensurate replenishment constitutes a **depletion of metabolic capital**, producing measurable individual and public-health harms.  
3. Sanctuary rights are **non-rivalrous public goods**: their exercise by one person or community does not diminish their availability to others and routinely enhances collective wellbeing.  
4. Sanctuaries are not amenities; they are essential infrastructure for human and ecological flourishing, equivalent in importance to clean air and water.

### The Four Pillars

#### Pillar 1 – Temporal Sanctuaries: The Right to Sacred and Uncommodified Time
- Absolute Right to Disconnect – legally enforceable 11 consecutive hours daily + full weekends; zero work contact outside designated hours  
- Collective Rest Protocols – binding municipal/regional “quiet days” or “planetary sabbaths”  
- Seasonal & Life-Cycle Sanctuaries – solstices, menstrual leave, parental/bereavement leave, coming-of-age periods  
- Debt-Justice Integration – interest and collections paused during sanctuary time  
- Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty – non-Gregorian calendars officially recognized  

#### Pillar 2 – Spatial Sanctuaries: The Right to Uncommodified Place
- Analog-Only Zones (“Vila-vagnen Protocol”) – every transit system must maintain permanent silent/analog cars  
- Third Place Protection Act – every neighbourhood guaranteed free, loitering-permitted, weather-protected public spaces with seating, sanitation, water, and heating/cooling  
  - **Sanctuary Stewardship Clause:** Maintenance, beautification, safety-patrol, and programming of Third Places is recognized Care Work compensated in Hearts (AUBI Layer 2). This turns sanctuaries into community-employment engines and prevents dereliction.  
- Sonic Sanctuaries – enforceable decibel ceilings + silence easements  
- Right to Darkness – mandatory dark-sky compliance (new builds immediate, existing urban areas by 2040)  
- Children’s Sanctuary Zones – 500 m commercial-free radius around schools and playgrounds  
- Climate Refuge Sanctuaries – immediate sanctuary status for displaced persons  
- Indigenous-Led Baseline Sanctuary Zones (BAZs) – maximum protection tier by default  

#### Pillar 3 – Attention Defense Shield: The Right to Cognitive Metabolism
- Ban on Addiction Architecture – infinite scroll, auto-play, variable-ratio rewards prohibited  
- Mandatory Cognitive Environmental Impact Assessments for apps, platforms, and urban projects  
- Sanctuary-Compliant Design Standard – positive certification with tax benefits  
- Public-Interest Algorithm Standard – wellbeing over engagement  
- Visual Silence Protocol – prohibition of illuminated or moving digital advertising in public rights-of-way; mandatory adoption of “Clean City” (Cidade Limpa) standards for visual clutter in heritage, residential, and sanctuary zones  
- Attention Reparations Fund – 0.7 % micro-tax on digital advertising revenue  

#### Pillar 4 – The Right to Slowness: Anti-Acceleration Protocols
- Right to Professional Integrity – workers may refuse unsafe or unethical acceleration without retaliation  
- Slow Infrastructure Standards – binding nurse/patient ratios, class sizes, appointment durations, etc.  
- Anti-Hustle Labor Protections – “quiet quitting” as protected speech  
- Slow Cities / Slow Regions Certification – legally binding metrics  

### Emergency Permeability Protocol (applies Accord-wide)
Sanctuary boundaries remain fully permeable to **Tier 1 Life-Safety Alerts** (natural disasters, medical emergencies, imminent violence).  
Critical-infrastructure systems must technically distinguish between:  
- Commercial “urgency” (blocked during sanctuary periods)  
- Existential “emergency” (permitted to pass)  
Override authority rests with certified public-safety agencies only; private entities may not self-declare emergencies.

### Implementation Layer
1. Sanctuary Certification System (Bronze–Silver–Gold)  
   - Visual identifier: **The Sanctuary Sigil** (white circle on deep-green field)  
   Administered by the independent **Sanctuary Authority** (seats for labor, Indigenous nations, public health, youth)

2. Violation Response Protocols  
   - Warning → fine → civil penalty → criminal liability for systematic breaches  
   - Right of Private Action (any citizen may sue for personal harm)

3. Transition Support & Financing  
   - Attention Reparations Fund + progressive luxury-extraction tax  
   - Grants/loans for compliance

### Phased Implementation Roadmap
- Phase 1 (2026-2029): Right to Disconnect, Analog-Only transit, voluntary certification, pilot Third Places with paid Sanctuary Stewards  
- Phase 2 (2030-2035): Mandatory Cognitive & Visual Silence assessments, Sanctuary Breach as civil-rights violation  
- Phase 3 (2035+): Full reparations fund, binding Slow Infrastructure, universal climate-refugee sanctuary

### Cross-Framework Links
- Cognitive Sovereignty: “The Sanctuary Accord is the metabolic oxygen required for cognitive sovereignty to be more than theoretical.”  
- AUBI/Hearts: Funds Sanctuary Stewards and makes rest universal, not a privilege.  
- Planetary Health: Silence, darkness, and slowness are shared goods between human and more-than-human worlds.

This is now the final, fully interoperable, politically resilient version—ready for immediate drafting into treaty-level text or national legislation.
