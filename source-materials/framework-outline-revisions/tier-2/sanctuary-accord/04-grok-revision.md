# The Sanctuary Accord  
**Official Name:** The Sanctuary Accord – A Framework for Metabolic Rights, Sacred Time, and Protected Space  
**Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application)  
**Parent Domain:** Mental Health & Social Resilience  
**Status:** Binding civil-rights and public-health infrastructure (non-optional once ratified)

### Preamble – Foundational Principles
1. Human consciousness and the lived body are metabolically costly systems that require regular periods of low stimulation, silence, darkness, seasonal rhythm, and social nutrient density in order to maintain long-term health and resilience.  
2. Extraction of attention, time, or biophysical energy without commensurate replenishment constitutes a **depletion of metabolic capital**, producing measurable individual and public-health harms.  
3. Sanctuary rights are **non-rivalrous public goods**: their exercise by one person or community does not diminish their availability to others and routinely enhances collective wellbeing.  
4. Sanctuaries are not amenities or lifestyle choices; they are essential infrastructure for human and ecological flourishing, equivalent in importance to clean air and water.

### The Four Pillars

#### Pillar 1 – Temporal Sanctuaries: The Right to Sacred and Uncommodified Time
- **Absolute Right to Disconnect** – Extension and fortification of existing labor-law rest periods (minimum 11 consecutive hours daily + full weekends) into the digital era; legally unenforceable work contact outside designated hours.  
- **Collective Rest Protocols** – Municipalities and regions may declare binding “quiet days” or “planetary sabbaths” with pre-approved critical-infrastructure down-cycling plans.  
- **Seasonal & Life-Cycle Sanctuaries** – Protected time for solstices, equinoxes, menstrual leave, parental leave, bereavement, coming-of-age, and other culturally or biologically significant transitions.  
- **Debt-Justice Integration** – Interest accrual and debt-collection activity suspended during any designated sanctuary period.  
- **Indigenous Temporal Sovereignty** – Official recognition of non-Gregorian calendars for scheduling, leave, and collective rest.

#### Pillar 2 – Spatial Sanctuaries: The Right to Uncommodified Place
- **Analog-Only Zones (“Vila-vagnen Protocol”)** – Every public-transit system must maintain at least one permanently analog/silent car or section; long-distance trains must offer silence cars.  
- **Third Place Protection Act** – Every residential zone entitled to free, loitering-permitted, weather-protected public spaces equipped with seating, sanitation, drinking water, and (where needed) heating/cooling. Privatization or commercial activation of these spaces prohibited.  
- **Sonic Sanctuaries** – Legally enforceable decibel ceilings in residential zones, hospitals, libraries, and all designated nature areas; “silence preservation easements” available.  
- **Right to Darkness** – Mandatory dark-sky compliance in all new developments; existing urban areas phased into compliance by 2040.  
- **Children’s Sanctuary Zones** – Strict 500 m commercial-free and advertising-free radius around schools, daycare centers, and public playgrounds.  
- **Climate Refuge Sanctuaries** – Immediate right to rest, non-extraction, and sanctuary status for climate-displaced persons.  
- **Indigenous-Led Baseline Sanctuary Zones (BAZs)** – Automatically accorded maximum protection tier.

#### Pillar 3 – Attention Defense Shield: The Right to Cognitive Metabolism
- **Ban on Addiction Architecture** – Infinite scroll, auto-play, and variable-ratio reward schedules prohibited in all consumer-facing digital products.  
- **Mandatory Cognitive Environmental Impact Assessments** – Required for new apps, platforms, urban developments, and public-space designs.  
- **Sanctuary-Compliant Design Standard** – Positive certification standard published and maintained by the administering agency; developers who meet it receive fast-track approval and tax benefits.  
- **Public-Interest Algorithm Standard** – Any algorithm receiving public funds or operating in public space must optimize for wellbeing and contemplation, not engagement metrics.  
- **Attention Reparations Fund** – Financed by a 0.7 % micro-tax on digital-advertising revenue; disbursed to individuals, schools, and communities harmed by predatory design.

#### Pillar 4 – The Right to Slowness: Anti-Acceleration Protocols
- **Right to Professional Integrity (formerly “Protection of Careful Work”)** – Workers may legally refuse acceleration demands that compromise safety, quality, or ethical standards without retaliation.  
- **Slow Infrastructure Standards** – Binding maximum patient/nurse ratios, maximum class sizes, minimum appointment durations in healthcare, etc.  
- **Anti-Hustle Labor Protections** – Bans on mandatory “productivity culture” training”; “quiet quitting” recognized as protected speech.  
- **Slow Cities / Slow Regions Certification** – Legally binding tier with measurable indicators (walkability, noise, darkness, third-place density, etc.).

### Implementation Layer
1. **Sanctuary Certification System**  
   - Three tiers: Bronze → Silver → Gold  
   - Visual identifier: **The Sanctuary Sigil** (white circle on deep-green field)  
   - Administered by an independent **Sanctuary Authority** (multi-stakeholder council with guaranteed seats for labor, Indigenous nations, public-health experts, and youth).

2. **Violation Response Protocols**  
   - Tiered sanctions: Warning → Administrative fine → Civil penalty → Criminal liability for systematic breaches  
   - **Right of Private Action**: Any individual may sue for damages if a sanctuary right is violated and harms them (modeled on disability-rights enforcement)  
   - “Systematic breach” defined as ≥5 proven violations in 12 months or an official policy mandating violation.

3. **Transition Support & Financing**  
   - Funded jointly by the Attention Reparations Fund and a progressive luxury-extraction tax  
   - Grants and low-interest loans for businesses, transit authorities, and municipalities adapting to new mandates.

### Phased Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (2026-2029)** – “Low-Hanging Fruit”  
      Right to Disconnect laws, Analog-Only transit zones, voluntary certification, pilot Third Places  
- **Phase 2 (2030-2035)** – Systemic Integration  
      Cognitive Impact Assessments become mandatory, Sanctuary Breach as civil-rights violation, Sonic/Darkness standards enforced  
- **Phase 3 (2035 onward)** – Full Realization  
      Attention Reparations Fund active, Slow Infrastructure standards binding, full integration with Indigenous sovereignty and climate-refugee protocols

### Strengthened Cross-Framework Links
- **Cognitive Sovereignty Framework** – “The Sanctuary Accord provides the metabolic oxygen without which cognitive sovereignty cannot be meaningfully exercised.”  
- **AUBI/Hearts Economy** – Makes sanctuary universal rather than a privilege of the leisure class.  
- **Hearthlight Protocol** – Children’s Sanctuary Zones are its direct spatial expression.  
- **Planetary Health Framework** – Human metabolic health and ecosystem health are bi-directionally linked: healthy ecosystems supply silence, darkness, and rhythm; human slowness is required to maintain ecosystem health.
