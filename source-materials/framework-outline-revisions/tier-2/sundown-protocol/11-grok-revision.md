# The Sundown Protocol (Version 0.5)

### A Just Transition Framework for Retiring Harmful Industries and Rebirthing Regenerative Futures

*This is an enhanced draft (Version 0.5) incorporating feedback from Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and ChatGPT. It is designed for iterative co-creation with workers, communities, Indigenous peoples, and youth, aligning with the GGF's commitment to participatory governance and justice.*

### **1. Introduction: A Pro-Future Transition**

#### **The Challenge**

Legacy industries (e.g., fossil fuels, extractive mining) accelerate the planetary polycrisis through business models incompatible with a regenerative future. Representing trillions in infrastructure and employing millions, these industries cannot be left to chaotic market-driven decline, which would devastate communities and strand workers. A voluntary transition is insufficient to meet planetary boundary timelines.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Sundown Protocol is not anti-industry; it is a pro-future roadmap designed to help vital sectors and their workforces 'graduate' into a new, regenerative economy. Inspired by Germany’s coal phase-out, Ecuador’s Yasuní-ITT initiative, and the **Aegis Protocol**’s transition of the military-industrial complex, it ensures a just, compassionate, and enforceable transition that protects workers, communities, and ecosystems while positioning first-movers as global leaders.

#### **The Framework**

As a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework**, the Sundown Protocol delivers the governance, legal, financial, and social architecture for the phased decommissioning of industries identified as existentially harmful by the **Planetary Health Council**. It complements the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework (REF)** as the mandatory, time-bound pathway for entities unable to achieve voluntary regenerative certification, operationalizing the **Treaty for Our Only Home**’s commitment to ecological integrity.

> **Why Now? The Urgency of a Managed Transition**  
> Planetary boundaries are nearing critical thresholds, as monitored by the `council_planetary_health`. Closing policy windows demand orderly action to prevent chaotic economic collapse and irreversible climate tipping points, making a managed transition an urgent necessity.

---

### **2. Core Principles**

The Sundown Protocol is guided by tailored GGF principles:

- **Just Transition First**: The well-being, security, and future prosperity of workers and communities are the primary success metrics. All planning prioritizes their agency and protection.
- **Restorative & Reparative Justice**: The process heals historical ecological and social harms, guided by the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**’s Truth & Reconciliation processes.
- **Polluter Pays & Precautionary Principle**: Legacy industries primarily fund the transition, ensuring the burden does not fall on the public.
- **Orderly & Predictable Decommissioning**: Managed to prevent economic shocks, ensuring energy and resource stability via the **Conduit Protocol**.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Transition and remediation activities on traditional lands are subject to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and its **FPIC 2.0** protocols.
- **Regenerative Advantage**: First-movers gain expertise in decommissioning and restoration, positioning them as global leaders.
- **Strategic Incentivization**: Participation is framed as an opportunity, with economic and geopolitical benefits for early adopters.
- **Enforceable Compliance**: Non-compliance triggers sanctions and asset seizures to ensure adherence to timelines.

- Timelines adjust based on technological breakthroughs or climate urgency, with `council_planetary_health` escalation authority.

#### **Bioregional Adaptation & Geopolitical Playbooks**

- The `institution_office_just_transition` develops **Bioregional Transition Typologies** and **Geopolitical Playbooks** (e.g., petro-state transitions to hydrogen/solar leadership), guided by `framework_nested_sovereignty`.  
- **Differentiated Pathways for the Global South**: Enhanced technical support and compliance linked to `mechanism_gcf` access and debt relief via `framework_financial_systems`.  
- Supports regenerative economic identities, inspired by the Ruhr Valley and Yasuní-ITT.

#### **The Regenerative Advantage: Reframing the Transition**

- Positions first-movers as global leaders in decommissioning, restoration, and circular economy logistics.  
- The **Graduating an Industry** narrative, led by `institution_legacy_council`, `framework_synoptic`, and `institution_gimn`, frames transition as an honorable evolution (e.g., “The Last Coal Miner, The First Geothermal Engineer”).

#### **Resilience Compact**

### **7. Conclusion: A Compassionate End and a New Beginning**

The Sundown Protocol transforms endings into beginnings, retiring unsustainable industries through a compassionate, incentivized, and enforceable process. By integrating voluntary pathways, robust enforcement, Indigenous oversight, youth empowerment, and cultural resonance, it ensures a just transition that honors workers, communities, and the planet, making the shift to a regenerative future both inevitable and desirable.
