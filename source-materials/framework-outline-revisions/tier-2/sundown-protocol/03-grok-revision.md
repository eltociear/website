# The Sundown Protocol (Version 0.2)

### A GGF Framework for the Managed, Just Transition of Legacy Industries

*This is an enhanced draft (Version 0.2) incorporating feedback from Claude and clarifications from Gemini. It is designed for iterative co-creation with affected workers, communities, and Indigenous peoples, aligning with the GGF's commitment to participatory governance.*

### **1. Introduction: The Necessity of a Managed Sunset**

**The Challenge:** Legacy industries (e.g., fossil fuels, extractive mining) are locked into business models incompatible with a regenerative future, accelerating the planetary polycrisis. Representing trillions in infrastructure and employing millions, these industries cannot be left to chaotic market-driven decline, which would devastate communities and strand workers. A voluntary transition is insufficient to meet planetary boundary timelines.

**The Opportunity:** The Sundown Protocol provides a compassionate, pragmatic, and orderly pathway to sunset harmful industries while protecting workers, communities, and ecosystems. Modeled on the **Aegis Protocol**'s transition of the military-industrial complex and inspired by real-world successes like Germany’s 60-year coal phase-out, it ensures a just transition that bridges an extractive past to a regenerative future.

**The Framework:** As a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework**, the Sundown Protocol delivers the governance, legal, financial, and social architecture for the phased decommissioning of industries identified as existentially harmful by the **Planetary Health Council**. It complements the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework (REF)** as the mandatory, time-bound pathway for entities unable to achieve voluntary regenerative certification, operationalizing the **Treaty for Our Only Home**’s commitment to ecological integrity.

### **2. Core Principles**

The Sundown Protocol is guided by tailored GGF principles:

- **Just Transition First**: The well-being, security, and future prosperity of workers and communities are the primary success metrics. All planning prioritizes their agency and protection.
- **Restorative & Reparative Justice**: The process actively heals historical ecological and social harms, guided by the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**’s Truth & Reconciliation processes.
- **Polluter Pays & Precautionary Principle**: Legacy industries primarily fund the transition, ensuring the burden does not fall on the public.
- **Orderly & Predictable Decommissioning**: Managed to prevent economic shocks, ensuring energy and resource stability via the **Conduit Protocol**.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Transition and remediation activities on traditional lands are subject to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and its **FPIC 2.0** protocols.
- **Regenerative Advantage**: First-mover regions and companies gain expertise in decommissioning and restoration, positioning them as global leaders.

#### **Core Entities:**

- **Framework (`framework_sundown_protocol`):** The parent framework.
- **Governing Council (`council_global_transition`):** A sub-council of the Meta-Governance framework.
  - **Mandate**: Receives **Planetary Health Council** directives on industries requiring transition, setting binding timelines and phase-out schedules.
  - **Composition**: Tripartite representation from workers (global unions), communities (BAZ councils, civil society), and GGF institutions.
- **Operational Institution (`institution_office_just_transition`):** The primary operational body.
  - **Mandate**: Manages end-to-end transition, developing decommissioning roadmaps, overseeing retraining via **Work in Liberation**, and coordinating reparations/restoration. It also manages the **initiative_transition_champions** (Industry Insider Champions Program) to amplify pro-transition industry voices.
- **Financial Mechanism (`mechanism_legacy_transition_fund`):** The financial engine.
  - **Mandate**: Governs the **Reparations Levy** (a tax on transitioning industries’ revenue) and directs capital to the **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust** and remediation efforts.
- **Legal Protocol (`protocol_worker_community_protection`):** A binding charter of rights.
  - **Mandate**: Guarantees worker protections (pensions, healthcare, retraining stipends via **AUBI**) and community investments (regenerative infrastructure, health monitoring), enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.
- **Knowledge Platform (`platform_transition_observatory`):** A global learning network.
  - **Mandate**: Connects to the `platform_regeneration_community` to share real-time data, best practices, and lessons between transitioning regions.
- **Cultural Institution (`institution_legacy_council`):** Industry Legacy Councils.
  - **Mandate**: Worker-community-Indigenous partnerships to guide transition narratives, preserve industrial heritage, and co-design dignified closure rituals.

#### **Crisis & Temporal Coordination:**

- In rapid industry collapse, the `process_crisis_command` (from `framework_meta_gov`) triggers emergency-managed transitions.
- Implementation balances immediate worker needs, medium-term community diversification, and long-term ecological restoration via the `protocol_cross_temporal` (from `framework_meta_gov`).

### **4. Implementation Pathway: A Phased & Managed Approach**

The protocol is activated by scientific and ethical thresholds, with adaptive timelines.

- **Phase 0: Pre-Transition Assessment (Year 0)**
  - Conducts regional resilience mapping and community readiness evaluations, guided by the `framework_nested_sovereignty`.
  - Includes **Worker and Community Consent Protocols** to ensure affected populations shape timing and approach.
  - Performs **Regional Resilience Assessments** to identify alternative economic opportunities.

- **Phase 1: Identification & Designation (Year 1)**
  - The **Planetary Health Council**, using the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**, identifies an industry (e.g., thermal coal) for sunset.
  - The **Global Transition Council** ratifies a binding global phase-out timeline (e.g., 2040).

- **Phase 2: Transition Roadmap Co-Creation (Years 1-3)**
  - The **Office of Just Transition** convenes companies, worker unions, community representatives, Indigenous knowledge holders, and **Youth Future Councils**.
  - A binding **Transition Roadmap** details decommissioning schedules, asset transfers, retraining (via **Work in Liberation**’s Community Work Teams), and community investments.
  - Companies achieving **REF** certification exit the protocol.
  - Incorporates **Indigenous Knowledge Integration** for land restoration and sustainable resource management.

- **Phase 3: Managed Decommissioning & Remediation (Years 3-15+)**
