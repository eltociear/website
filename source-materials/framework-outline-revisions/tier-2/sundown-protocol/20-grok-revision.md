### **1. Introduction: A Pro-Future Transition**

#### **The Challenge**

Legacy industries (e.g., fossil fuels, extractive mining, industrial agriculture) accelerate the planetary polycrisis through business models incompatible with a regenerative future. Representing trillions in infrastructure and employing millions, these industries cannot be left to chaotic market-driven decline, which would devastate communities and strand workers. A voluntary transition is insufficient to meet planetary boundary timelines.

#### **The Opportunity**

The Sundown Protocol is not anti-industry; it is a pro-future roadmap designed to help vital sectors and their workforces 'graduate' into a new, regenerative economy. Inspired by Germany’s coal phase-out, Ecuador’s Yasuní-ITT initiative, and the **Aegis Protocol**’s transition of the military-industrial complex, it ensures a just, compassionate, and enforceable transition that protects workers, communities, and ecosystems while positioning first-movers as global leaders.

#### **The Framework**

As a **Tier 2 Foundational Application Framework**, the Sundown Protocol delivers the governance, legal, financial, and social architecture for the phased decommissioning of industries identified as existentially harmful by the **Planetary Health Council**. It complements the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework (REF)** as the mandatory, time-bound pathway for entities unable to achieve voluntary regenerative certification, operationalizing the **Treaty for Our Only Home**’s commitment to ecological integrity.

> **Why Now? The Urgency of a Managed Transition**  
> Planetary boundaries, as monitored by the `council_planetary_health`, are nearing critical thresholds. Closing policy windows and the risk of climate tipping points demand orderly action to prevent chaotic economic collapse and ensure a just transition.

---

### **2. Core Principles**

The Sundown Protocol is guided by tailored GGF principles:

- **Just Transition First**: The well-being, security, and future prosperity of workers and communities are the primary success metrics. All planning prioritizes their agency and protection.
- **Restorative & Reparative Justice**: The process heals historical ecological and social harms, guided by the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**’s Truth & Reconciliation processes.
- **Polluter Pays & Precautionary Principle**: Legacy industries primarily fund the transition, ensuring the burden does not fall on the public.
- **Orderly & Predictable Decommissioning**: Managed to prevent economic shocks, ensuring energy and resource stability via the **Conduit Protocol**.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Transition and remediation activities on traditional lands are subject to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and its **FPIC 2.0** protocols.
- **Regenerative Advantage**: First-movers gain expertise in decommissioning and restoration, positioning them as global leaders.
- **Strategic Incentivization**: Participation is framed as an opportunity, with economic and geopolitical benefits for early adopters.
- **Enforceable Compliance**: Non-compliance triggers sanctions and asset seizures to ensure adherence to timelines.
- **Adaptive Scalability**: Industry-specific modules ensure tailored approaches for diverse sectors.
- **Generational Justice**: Long-term ecological and social outcomes prioritize future generations.
