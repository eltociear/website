### **1. Vision**

In the face of the polycrisis, humanity experiences unprecedented loss—of species, ecosystems, cultures, and stability. This collective grief, including the profound pain of ecological loss (*solastalgia*[^1]), is not a pathology to be suppressed but a sacred responsibility to be held. This framework establishes the governance, rituals, and commons to honor death as a dignified transition, process collective grief as a source of communal wisdom, and memorialize loss as a commitment to intergenerational healing. We empower communities to lead their own practices, transforming grief from a private burden into a shared, regenerative practice, weaving remembrance into the fabric of a resilient, compassionate civilization.

[^1]: *Solastalgia*: The distress caused by environmental change or loss, such as the degradation of one’s home ecosystem, often experienced as a sense of powerlessness or grief.

---

### **2. Core Principles**

1. **Grief as a Sacred Commons**: Collective grief is a shared experience and a public good, requiring communal spaces and rituals for its expression and transformation.
2. **Dignity in Transition**: Every sentient being has the right to a dignified, compassionate, and culturally appropriate end-of-life process.
3. **Ecological Kinship & Mourning**: Humanity has a sacred duty to witness, mourn, and memorialize the loss of our non-human kin and the desecration of ecosystems, recognizing **non-human grief** (e.g., animal mourning behaviors, ecosystem-level trauma) as integral to this kinship.
4. **Ritual Integrity & Pluralism**: Grief and memorial practices must honor the diverse wisdom of global traditions, guided by the principle of non-appropriation and deep cultural respect.
5. **Remembrance as a Regenerative Act**: Memorializing loss is a living practice that informs future action and strengthens planetary stewardship.
6. **Community-Led Empowerment**: All rituals, responses, and practices must be co-designed and led by affected communities, with resources and structures to support their sovereignty.

---

### **3. A Typology of Grief (Non-Exhaustive)**

To guide implementation and training, this framework recognizes distinct yet interconnected types of grief, informed by community input and cultural wisdom:
- **Personal Grief**: Loss of loved ones, family, or close relationships.
- **Ecological Grief**: Distress from ecosystem collapse, species extinction, or environmental degradation (e.g., solastalgia, eco-anxiety, species grief).
- **Cultural & Historical Grief**: Loss of languages, traditions, ancestral lands, or cultural identity due to colonial trauma or displacement.
- **Future Grief**: Anticipatory grief for potential losses (e.g., youth fearing climate-driven futures).
- **Unspoken Grief**: Grief not socially acknowledged, often experienced by marginalized communities (e.g., disenfranchised losses).

This typology is non-rigid, serving as a flexible guide for designing rituals, training counselors, and tailoring interventions to community needs.

---

### **4. Systemic Integration**

This Tier 3 framework is a critical component of the GGF’s cultural and health layers, deeply interconnected with core operating systems.

- **Guidance and Oversight**:
  - Guided by the foundational wisdom of `framework_indigenous` concerning ancestors and life cycles.
  - Core rituals and memorial practices overseen by the **Council for Ritual & Remembrance** (`council_crr`), a sub-council of `council_cawc`, ensuring cultural integrity via `protocol_cultural_grief` with a **Living Consent Mechanism** including a **Sunset Clause** (3-5 year renewal cycle).
  - The `council_earth` provides guidance for rituals addressing ecological loss, including **non-human grief**, co-designed with communities.
  - **Process Protocol Renewal Ritual** (`process_protocol_renewal_ritual`): A periodic (every 5-7 years) community-led review of `protocol_dtp`, `protocol_cultural_grief`, and `protocol_non_human_grief` through storytelling and global reflection days, facilitated by `council_cawc`.
  - **Healing Justice Lens**: Applied across all components to address systemic oppression (e.g., environmental racism, historical trauma), integrated into the **Community Co-Design Toolkit** and **Ritual Template Bank**.
- **Dependencies and Collaboration**:
  - Depends on `framework_mental_health` for trauma-informed principles, **Ecological Mental Health Emergency Protocols**, and **Mental Health System Bridge** for clinical referrals.
  - Collaborates with `framework_cultural_heritage` to archive mourning traditions with community consent.
  - Informs `framework_planetary_health` via emotional processing tools linked to `metric_bhi` (Biosphere Health Index).
  - Leverages `framework_arts_flourishing` for memorials, rituals, and **Ancestral Offerings Archive**.
  - Integrates with `framework_biodiversity` and `framework_soil_health` for **Species & Ecosystem Memorial Registry** and **Restorative Action Plans**.
  - Collaborates with `framework_drr` and `process_crisis_command` for **Crisis Grief Protocol** within **Grief First Responder** training.
  - Engages `framework_youth` and `framework_education` for **Age-Responsive Grief Protocols**.
  - Uses `framework_gaian_trade`’s **Digital Product Passports** to track restorative actions.
  - Amplifies narratives via `framework_synoptic` and `institution_gimn` for **Policy Advocacy Interface**.
- **Implementation and Funding**:
  - Care, death doulaship, and ritual facilitation rewarded with `mechanism_hearts`, including **Grief Stewardship Tokens** for contributions to memorials and the **Ancestral Offerings Archive**.
  - **Grief Resilience Fund**, a mandated allocation within `mechanism_gcf`, supports microgrants and compensation, overseen by `council_crr`.
  - `process_indigenous_healing_grants` allocates resources for Indigenous-led initiatives.
  - Place-based memorials and rituals governed by `institution_baz`.

### **7. Potential Challenges & Mitigations**

- **Cultural Appropriation of Grief Rituals**:
  - **Mitigation**: Oversight by `council_cawc` and adherence to `protocol_fpic2` and **Living Consent Mechanism** with **Sunset Clause**.
- **Politicization or Weaponization of Grief**:
  - **Mitigation**: Core principles and **Synoptic Protocol** ensure respectful representations. **Grief-to-Action Interface** with **Policy Advocacy Interface** is optional.
- **Funding for Intangible & Essential Care Work**:
  - **Mitigation**: Supported by `mechanism_hearts` with **Grief Stewardship Tokens**, **Grief Resilience Fund**, and `process_indigenous_healing_grants`.
- **Extractive Research Practices**:
  - **Mitigation**: `institution_egri_hub` operates under Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles.
- **Technological Divides**:
  - **Mitigation**: Opt-in **AR Memorials** with **Offline AR** alternatives (e.g., NFC tags, QR codes).
- **Scalability Risks**:
  - **Mitigation**: Capacity-building workshops, phased onboarding, and BAZ readiness evaluations.

---

### **8. Monitoring & Evaluation**

- **Cultural Vitality Index**: Measures contribution to `tool_cv_index`, focusing on community cohesion and ritual participation.
- **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (`metric_lmci`)**: Reflects framework effectiveness in community connection and meaning-making.
- **Grief-to-Resilience Index**: Developed by `institution_egri_hub`, approved by `council_global_metrology`, with:
  - **Transformative Action Score**: Measures capacity for collective action.
  - **Collective Efficacy Score**: Tracks shared capacity, ritual participation, and resilience networks.
  - **Cultural Resonance Sub-Metric**: Measures alignment with community values via surveys and storytelling.
- **Qualitative Audits**: Conducted via **Grief Feedback Pathway** through reflection circles.
- **Community Consent Audits**: Evaluations of `protocol_cultural_grief`, **Living Consent Mechanism**, and community satisfaction.

---

### **9. Documentation & Presentation**

To enhance comprehension and stakeholder engagement, the framework includes:
- **Internal Flow Diagram**: Illustrates interactions between Pillars and processes.
- **System Integration Map**: Visualizes connections to GGF frameworks and councils.
- **Stakeholder Engagement Package**: Includes a 2-page executive summary, infographics, and a **Grief Commons Manifesto**, amplified by `framework_synoptic` and `institution_gimn`.
These materials will be co-created for publication by Q1 2026.
