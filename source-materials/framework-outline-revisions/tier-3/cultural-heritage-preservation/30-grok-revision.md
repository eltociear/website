## **Executive Summary**

Project Tapestry serves as the Cultural Memory Operating System for humanity's collective heritage, embedding principles of cultural preservation, protocols, and standards within interconnected global frameworks such as the Treaty for Our Only Home, Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI), Work in Liberation, and Meta-Governance. This Indigenous-led approach ensures the sovereignty, vitality, and ethical evolution of tangible and intangible heritage through Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), fostering Right Relationship among human, non-human, and planetary systems.

At its core, the framework is guided by 11 principles, including Sovereign Stewardship, Biocultural Unity, Reparative Justice, and newly emphasized Inclusive Representation, which prioritizes intersectional balance across gender, disability, LGBTQ+, and migrant communities. Governance is decentralized under BAZs, with coordination via the Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council within Meta-Governance, supported by tools like quantum-safe archives, Stewardship Bonds, and the Cultural Vitality Index.

The implementation roadmap unfolds in three phases:  
- **Phase 1 (2025-2030: Foundation Building)**: Establish the Council, launch 5 BAZ pilots, digitize 100 endangered languages, and repatriate 30% of looted artifacts, funded by $100M in Stewardship Bonds.  
- **Phase 2 (2030-2040: Network Expansion)**: Scale to 50 BAZs, translate 1,000 languages, issue $1B in bonds, and integrate a cultural chamber in the Digital Justice Tribunal, aiming for 10% vitality increase.  
- **Phase 3 (2040-2050: Global Integration)**: Achieve 200 operational BAZs with full quantum-safe archives, enforce cultural impact assessments, and target 80% cultural vitality.  

By 2050, all cultures will have tools for sovereign preservation, integrated with economic security and legal protections. The 100-year vision (2125) positions cultural heritage as a cornerstone of interplanetary civilization, sustained by BAZ networks and innovative mechanisms. This framework addresses risks like climate impacts and AI biases, aligns with international laws such as UNDRIP, and promotes reparative justice, ensuring no culture is lost.
