# Revised Outline for Nested Economies Framework

## Executive Summary
- **Vision**: The Nested Economies Framework fosters economies of **Right Relationship**, balancing local autonomy with global cooperation to ensure equitable, regenerative, and culturally vibrant systems.
- **Approach**: Distinct from EU’s centralized regulations, WTO’s trade focus, degrowth’s anti-growth stance, and doughnut economics’ static boundaries, it integrates **Hearts** as a global coordinating currency, **Leaves** for micro-recognition, and a four-layered **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)** system for resource justice.
- **Goals**: Achieve 70% local economic sovereignty, 80% equitable resource access, 90% system interoperability within 10 years of implementation.
- **Key Features**: **Hearts** and **Leaves** currencies, ethical trade zones, four-layered AUBI, **Love Ledger** for value tracking, global commons governance via the **Social Resilience Council**.
- **Stakeholders**: Municipalities, regional councils, NGOs, indigenous communities, global governance bodies, with pilots starting in Year 1.
- **Revision**: 3.0 (2025-09-03)
- **Version History**:
  - **3.0 (2025-09-03)**: Clarified unique role as economic subsidiarity framework; removed redundant AUBI details with cross-references; separated Love Ledger from Hearts mechanisms; updated Quick Start Guide to BAZ Starter Pack; enhanced governance roles.
  - **2.1 (2025-07-06)**: Added "Community Weaver Role" sub-section in Section 8, defining their role in *Hearts* and *Love Ledger* training, stakeholder engagement, and validation aligned with LMCI, with AUBI Layer 2 compensation. Integrated Green Job Score as a multiplier for AUBI Leaves in Section 2.2, linked to *Inter-Currency Translation Layer*. Clarified Social Resilience Council’s mandate in Section 5.3 as *Hearts* supply management, stakeholder coordination, and ethical oversight, distinct from Fractal Labor Parliament’s work standards. Maintained Indigenous governance and AUBI integration.
  - **2.0 (2025-07-04)**: Embedded *Hearts*, *Leaves*, *Love Ledger*, and four-layered AUBI; introduced Social Resilience Council and Earth Council; made date-agnostic; added funding via Automation Tax, Resource Taxes, commons dividends.
  - **1.0 (2025-06-16)**: Initial framework with nested systems, *Hearts*, and AUBI concepts.

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Create a resilient economic integration framework to foster **Right Relationship**—balanced, regenerative connections between individuals, communities, and the planet. While the AUBI Framework defines the GGF's currency and social safety net, the Nested Economies Framework defines the **'where' and 'how'** of economic activity. It provides the architectural rules for how local BAZ economies, regional trade networks, and the global commons can interoperate without sacrificing local autonomy.
- **Scope**: Address global challenges (inequality, resource depletion, cultural erosion) through nested systems powered by **Hearts** and AUBI.
- **Distinctions**:
  - *Vs. EU*: Prioritizes local diversity over regulatory uniformity.
  - *Vs. WTO*: Centers **Resource Justice** and sustainability over trade maximization.
  - *Vs. Degrowth*: Supports regenerative growth via **Hearts** and **Leaves**.
  - *Vs. Doughnut Economics*: Offers dynamic interoperability via the **Inter-Currency Translation Layer**.
- **Comparative Table**:
  | Framework | Focus | Strength | Weakness |
  |-----------|-------|----------|----------|
  | EU | Regulatory harmonization | Economic unity | Limits autonomy |
  | WTO | Global trade | Market access | Ignores equity |
  | Degrowth | Reduced consumption | Ecological focus | Stagnation risk |
  | Doughnut Economics | Boundaries | Holistic metrics | Less interoperable |
  | Nested Economies | Right Relationship, justice | Autonomy, **Hearts**, AUBI | Complex implementation |
- **Framework Family Tree**: Diagram tracing lineage (cooperative economics, commons theory, blockchain interoperability) and innovations (**Hearts**, AUBI, **Love Ledger**).
- **Goals**: Equitable resource distribution, regenerative practices, inclusive participation measured by the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**.
- **Key Principles** (color-coded):
  - <span style="color: blue;">Sovereignty</span>: Local policy control via community-owned **Hearts wallets**.
  - <span style="color: green;">Interoperability</span>: Value exchange through the **Inter-Currency Translation Layer**.
  - <span style="color: red;">Resource Justice</span>: Equitable access via the **AUBI Framework** and its **Hearts/Leaves** currencies.
  - <span style="color: purple;">Adaptability</span>: Flexible governance via **Social Resilience Council** and **Earth Council**.
- **Visualization**: Nested systems diagram (green local circles for **Hearts** circulation, blue regional webs for trade, red global sphere for commons governance, arrows for flows).
- **Key Actors**: Municipalities, regional councils, NGOs, indigenous groups, **Social Resilience Council**, **Earth Council**.
- **Minimum Requirements**: Transparent **Love Ledger** reporting, basic digital access (e.g., mobile networks).
- **Quick Start Guide**:
  1. Form a Convening Circle.
  2. Establish a Proto-Treasury.
  3. Recruit Community Providers.
  4. Formalize a BAZ Council.

## 2. Core Economic Integration Principles
### 2.1 Nested Economic Systems
- **Local**: Community-driven care economies using **Hearts** and **Leaves**, with informal care contributions recognized by the parallel **Love Ledger** system. This level involves chartered **Community Providers** delivering formal services redeemable for **Hearts**, supported by **Community Weavers** for on-the-ground facilitation, and stabilized by the **Hearts Treasury** (`mechanism_hearts_treasury`).
- **Regional**: Bioregional resource sharing and trade using **Hearts** for exchange.
- **Global**: Fair trade and sustainability standards managed by the **Global Commons Council**.
- **Prototype**: Mondragon Cooperative (Spain), adapted with **Hearts** and **Love Ledger**.

### 2.2 Interface Standards
- **Definition**: Cross-level exchange protocols for value and data (blockchain-based **Inter-Currency Translation Layer**).
- **Value Exchange**: Open APIs translating care, ecological work, and fiat into **Hearts**. Includes Green Job Score as a multiplier (1.0x–1.5x) for ecological contributions (e.g., reforestation, renewable energy projects), validated by the Fractal Labor Parliament, integrated with **Love Ledger** for **Hearts**/**Leaves** conversion.
- **Accountability**: Biannual audits via **Cross-Level Trust Protocol**.
- **Information Flow**: Encrypted open-source platforms, GDPR-compliant.
- **Example**: **Hearts** wallet app syncing with regional **Love Ledger** nodes, converting Green Job Score contributions to **Leaves**.
- **Conversion Table**:
  | **System**         | **Convert to *Hearts*/*Leaves* via...**                     |
  |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Care Acts          | Proof of Care score × impact multiplier (1-5)              |
  | Ecological Work    | Green Job Score × AUBI Leaves multiplier (1.0x–1.5x)        |
  | Fiat Donations     | 1:1 match via *Heartstarter*                               |
  | Time Banks         | Hours × regional wage index ÷ global *Hearts* index        |
  | Carbon Credits     | Tonnage × eco-impact factor (IPCC-based)                   |

### 2.3 Resource Justice
- **Commons Management**: Water, land, energy as commons, co-designed with indigenous stewardship protocols.
- **Anti-Exploitation**: Extraction caps (20% below baseline by Year 5).
- **Equitable Access**: Resource justice is primarily delivered through the four-layered payout architecture of the **AUBI Framework v5.0**, which provides a universal baseline and equitable bonuses.
- **Empowerment**: Indigenous and marginalized leadership (50% representation).
- **Gender Equity**: 50% women/non-binary representation in governance.
- **Disability Inclusion**: Screen readers, voice navigation for **Hearts** apps.
- **Prototype**: Bristol Pound (UK), reimagined with **Hearts** and **Love Ledger**.
