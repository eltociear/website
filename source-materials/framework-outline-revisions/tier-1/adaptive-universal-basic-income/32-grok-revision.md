## **1. Executive Summary**
- **Vision:** AUBI is the living expression of the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, channeling **Hearts** and **Leaves** as the lifeblood of a regenerative economy guided by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**. It ensures economic security, fosters flourishing societies, and nurtures **Right Relationship** with human and non-human communities, measured by the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**. Contributions are valued and ethically distributed via the Moral Operating System (MOS). The system operates through two parallel mechanisms: 1. A formal, monetized care economy supported by **Hearts** credits, which are earned by chartered **Community Providers** and stabilized by a **Hearts Treasury**. 2. An informal care economy recognized by the **Love Ledger**, which uses non-monetized **Gratitude Tokens** to build social cohesion and inform the **LMCI** metric.
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves traditional UBI into a four-layered system, delivering a universal baseline (hybrid fiat/Hearts), adaptive bonuses, equity-based supplements, and recognition of informal contributions, integrated with the **Meta-Governance Framework**, **Financial Systems Framework**, and **Treaty mechanisms**.
- **Goals:** Eliminate poverty, validate care and ecological work, promote cultural and spiritual flourishing, ensure reparative justice, and foster resilient societies in Right Relationship with the planet.
- **Key Features:**
  - Four-tiered payout structure, with Layer 0 as the philosophical foundation honoring relational wealth.
  - Financing via automation taxes, resource levies, Commons Dividends, and Hearts/Leaves, stabilized by Treaty’s Pillar 4.
  - Governance via **Social Resilience Council** under Meta-Governance, with Earth Council veto power.
  - LMCI rooted in Right Relationship, validated against GNH and OECD Better Life Index.
  - Crisis protocols coordinated by Meta-Governance, with Indigenous-led recovery.
  - Cultural adaptation with Indigenous sovereignty, FPIC 2.0, and Red Lines Clause.
  - Comprehensive appendices for failure recovery, political economy, technical architecture, and case studies.
- **Risks:** Gaming, digital divide, capital flight, cultural conflicts, mitigated through Indigenous-guided governance, AI audits, community validation, and stress testing protocols.
- **Readiness:** Ready for pilot development in Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), stakeholder engagement, and global coalition building.

## **2. Introduction: AUBI as the Heart of a Regenerative Civilization**

### **2.1. A Foundation for Right Relationship**
Guided by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**, AUBI is the economic engine for the Treaty’s social contract, ensuring economic security while nurturing **Right Relationship**—the interconnected web of human, non-human, and planetary life. It unlocks potential for innovation, community flourishing, and cultural revitalization, aligned with STR-206. The system operates through two parallel mechanisms: 1. A formal, monetized care economy supported by **Hearts** credits, which are earned by chartered **Community Providers** and stabilized by a **Hearts Treasury**. 2. An informal care economy recognized by the **Love Ledger**, which uses non-monetized **Gratitude Tokens** to build social cohesion and inform the **LMCI** metric.

**Right Relationship Defined:**
- **Economic Security:** Freedom from survival anxiety via a hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline.
- **Relational Wealth:** Prioritizing kinship, community, and ecological harmony (Layer 0).
- **Restorative Justice:** Reparations for historical and ecological harms (Layer 3).
- **Planetary Flourishing:** Contributions to care, culture, and ecology, rewarded by Hearts/Leaves.

**Historical Inspirations:** Indigenous gift economies, Alaska Permanent Fund, Brazil’s Bolsa Família, Finland’s UBI pilot, Kenya’s GiveDirectly, reimagined through Indigenous wisdom for global scalability.

### **2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI**
AUBI is a living system for enacting Treaty promises, channeling Hearts/Leaves in parallel with the non-monetized Love Ledger, guided by Indigenous principles.

| **Feature** | **Traditional UBI** | **Adaptive UBI (AUBI)** |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Welfare supplement | Expression of Right Relationship and Treaty social contract |
| **Payout** | Fixed fiat | Hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline, dynamic bonuses, Leaves for ecology |
| **Conditionality** | Unconditional | Unconditional baseline + voluntary contributions for Hearts/Leaves |
| **Metrics** | Poverty reduction | LMCI (Right Relationship, care, ecology, culture) |
| **Governance** | State-based | Social Resilience Council under Meta-Governance, Earth Council veto |
| **Cultural Approach** | Universal | Indigenous-guided, community-adapted with FPIC 2.0 |

### **2.3. The Guiding Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**
LMCI measures flourishing through **Right Relationship**, replacing GDP with metrics of human-land connection, care, and cultural vitality, validated against GNH and OECD Better Life Index.

**LMCI Components:**
- **Love (Care & Relationships):** Care hours, mentorship, social cohesion, validated by communities.
- **Meaning (Purpose & Growth):** Cultural preservation, knowledge sharing, spiritual flourishing.
- **Connection (Human-Land Harmony):** Ecological stewardship, sacred site health, community storytelling.

**Transition Strategy:** LMCI complements GDP for 5 years, with studies showing 7-12% productivity gains from enhanced wellbeing.

**Changes in v5.0:**
- Added LMCI validation against GNH and OECD Better Life Index for scientific rigor.

## **5. AUBI Payout Architecture: Indigenous-Guided Layers**

### **5.0. Layer 0: Relational Wealth (Philosophical Foundation)**
- **Purpose:** Honors unmonetized contributions (kinship, cultural wisdom, ecological care) as the foundation of Right Relationship.
- **Operationalization:**
  - Documented via Love Ledger with non-monetized **Gratitude Tokens**. The Love Ledger serves as a decentralized, community-validated registry that records acts of care, gratitude, and mutual support without assigning monetary value, fostering social cohesion and providing qualitative data to inform the LMCI.
  - Ceremonial recognition in community gatherings.
  - Transition pathways to Layer 2 via mentorship programs.
- **Cultural Integration:** Aligns with Indigenous gift economies, Ubuntu, and spiritual traditions.

### **5.1. Layer 1: Universal Baseline (Hybrid Fiat/Hearts)**
- **Purpose:** Ensures dignity with a hybrid baseline (70% fiat, 30% Hearts) for market and care economies.
- **Specifications:**
  - Covers all adults 18+, with education stipends and optional youth civic internships (ages 16-18) for early contributions.
  - Calculated via regional price indices, covering housing (40%), food (25%), utilities (15%), transport (10%), healthcare (10%).
  - Dynamic fiat/Hearts ratio adjusted by Social Resilience Council.
- **Safeguards:** AI inflation monitoring, Treaty arbitration for disputes.

### **5.2. Layer 2: Contribution & Development Bonus**
- **Purpose:** Rewards contributions to LMCI pillars, paid in Hearts.
- **Contributions:**
  - **Love:** Caregiving, mentorship, conflict resolution.
  - **Meaning:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation, spiritual care.
  - **Connection:** Ecological restoration (earns Leaves, adjusted by Green Job Score per FLP standards), community organizing.
- **Gaming Prevention:** AI anomaly detection, community audits, contribution decay (5% annually).
- **Dynamic Caps:** Bonuses capped at 50% of baseline for top income quintile, requiring greater community impact.
- Layer 2 bonuses are earned exclusively by formal, **chartered Community Providers** (`institution_community_provider`). Citizens spend their `Hearts` at these providers. The providers then redeem the accumulated `Hearts` at the **`Hearts Treasury`** (`mechanism_hearts_treasury`) for fiat currency. The verification happens through a formal **`Proof of Care`** (`process_proof_of_care`) protocol designed for these chartered organizations.

### **5.3. Layer 3: Equity & Needs-Based Bonus**
- **Purpose:** Delivers Treaty reparations for historical/ecological injustices, paid in Hearts.
- **Coverage:**
  - Health/disability support, caregiving, geographic equity, reparations for colonialism.
  - Portable LMCI scores for migrants/refugees.
- **Negative Adjustments (max -50%):** Applied for Ecocide or human rights violations, enforced by Digital Justice Tribunal.

**Changes in v5.0:**
- Added youth civic internships to Layer 1 for ages 16-18.
- Integrated dynamic caps for elite contributions in Layer 2.
