Of course. It's a critical step to ensure your foundational framework documents are perfectly aligned. The "Currency of Care" white paper introduced a more sophisticated, practical, and philosophically nuanced model for the AUBI system.

The core refinement is the **crucial separation of the monetized `Hearts` economy from the non-monetized `Love Ledger`**. Your current AUBI outline (v5.0) sometimes conflates these two, suggesting the Love Ledger verifies work for Hearts.

Here are the specific instructions for how to revise the AUBI Framework outline (`30-grok-revision.md`) to align it perfectly with the insights from "The Currency of Care" (`the-currency-of-care.md`).

---

### ## 1. Update the Core Concept in the Executive Summary & Introduction (Sections 1-2)

The first step is to introduce the refined "dual system" concept from the beginning.

* **Directive:** In the **Executive Summary** and **Introduction**, revise the description of the AUBI system to explicitly mention the two parallel systems:
    1.  A formal, monetized care economy supported by **`Hearts`** credits, which are earned by chartered **Community Providers** and stabilized by a **`Hearts Treasury`**.
    2.  An informal care economy recognized by the **`Love Ledger`**, which uses non-monetized **Gratitude Tokens** to build social cohesion and inform the **LMCI** metric.

This immediately clarifies the new, more sophisticated model for the reader.

### ## 2. Restructure the AUBI Payout Architecture (Section 5)

This is the most critical area for revision. You need to surgically separate the `Love Ledger` from the `Hearts` generation mechanism.

* **Directive for Section 5.0 (Layer 0: Relational Wealth):**
    * This is the new, correct home for the `Love Ledger`. **Move the primary description of the Love Ledger and its non-monetized Gratitude Tokens here.** Frame it as the foundational layer that makes *all* relational wealth visible, without commodifying it. This aligns perfectly with its purpose as described in "The Currency of Care".

* **Directive for Section 5.2 (Layer 2: Contribution & Development Bonus):**
    * **This section must be rewritten.** Remove the phrase "verified by Love Ledger."
    * Explain that Layer 2 bonuses are earned exclusively by formal, **chartered Community Providers** (`institution_community_provider`).
    * Describe the correct process: Citizens spend their `Hearts` at these providers. The providers then redeem the accumulated `Hearts` at the **`Hearts Treasury`** (`mechanism_hearts_treasury`) for fiat currency. The verification happens through a formal **`Proof of Care`** (`process_proof_of_care`) protocol designed for these chartered organizations, not the informal Love Ledger.

### ## 3. Detail the Economic Stabilization Mechanism (Section 6)

The `Hearts Treasury` is the key innovation for currency stability and needs to be formally included.

* **Directive:** In **Section 6 (Economic Architecture)**, add a new subsection titled `### 6.4 The Hearts Treasury: A Stability Anchor`.
* Explain its function as a financial clearinghouse, managed in partnership with local credit unions, that guarantees fiat redemption for `Hearts` at a stable rate.
* Clarify that it is initially capitalized by the **Global Commons Fund (GCF)** (`institution_gcf`) and sustained by levies, as detailed in the white paper.

---

### ## 4. Integrate the Grassroots Implementation Pathway (Section 7)

Your current implementation section is good but can be enhanced with the more detailed, bottom-up bootstrapping model from the white paper.

* **Directive:** In **Section 7 (Implementation Sequencing)**, add a new subsection titled `### 7.4 The Grassroots Bootstrapping Pathway (The BAZ Starter Pack)`.
* Outline the four-step process from "The Currency of Care":
    1.  **The Convening Circle:** A small group starts a concrete pilot project.
    2.  **The Proto-Treasury:** A simple, shared bank account to prove the concept.
    3.  **Provider Recruitment:** The circle expands by recruiting other local providers.
    4.  **Governance Formalization:** A **BAZ Council** (`institution_baz_council`) is elected only after the model shows initial success.
* This adds a realistic, accessible on-ramp to your implementation plan.

---

### ## 5. Add the Key Human Element (Section 7 or Appendix)

The **Community Weaver** is a critical role that needs to be formally recognized in the framework document.

* **Directive:** In **Section 7.3 (Staff Training)**, explicitly detail the role and training of **Community Weavers** (`process_community_weaver`).
* Describe them as the essential on-the-ground facilitators trained in cultural adaptation, low-tech tool implementation, and supporting Community Providers. This makes your implementation plan feel more human and practical.

By making these five key revisions, your **AUBI Framework** document will be perfectly aligned with the nuanced and powerful model you developed in **"The Currency of Care,"** ensuring conceptual consistency across your entire ecosystem.
