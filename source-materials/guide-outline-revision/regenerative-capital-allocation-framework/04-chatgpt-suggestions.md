Love this direction. Quick take:

**Grade:** **93 / A**
It’s coherent, systems-aware, and genuinely usable. The Five Principles → Scorecard → Role-based guidance → Thesis template flow is clear and practical. Strong cross-links into the wider GGF stack.&#x20;

## What’s already strong

* **Principles with teeth.** The Five Principles are crisp and mapped to existing GGF anchors (Hearthstone, Nested Sovereignty, etc.), which prevents “vibe-only ESG.”&#x20;
* **Scorecard depth.** The five categories cover ethics/social fabric, economic model, ecology, governance, and RoR—exactly the right span for systemic due diligence.&#x20;
* **Practitioner pathways.** Clear “Capital Weavers” guidance for philanthropies, impact funds, CIFs, and family offices—smart segmentation.&#x20;
* **Actionable scaffolding.** A fill-in-the-blanks thesis template, RoR walkthrough, and case studies in the appendices are spot on.&#x20;
* **GGF integration.** Ties to Hearthstone (stewardship), Sundown (just transition), Aurora (data standards), AUBI/Hearts–Leaves, and REF are already embedded.   &#x20;

## Gaps / risks to tighten

1. **Quant rigor for RoR.** RoR is introduced, but you’ll want a normalized formula (units, scaling, time horizons) so portfolios can be compared apples-to-apples.&#x20;
2. **Weighting + pass/fail gates.** The Scorecard lacks explicit weights and red-line thresholds (e.g., FPIC 2.0 must be met or the deal fails).&#x20;
3. **Greenwashing guardrails.** Add audit/assurance pathways (who verifies LMCI/BHI? what sampling?) and an escalation policy when performance drifts.&#x20;
4. **Capital structuring.** The playbook could show how to stack grants, guarantees, concessional debt, and equity—especially where Sundown/REF tools apply (e.g., Transition Bonds). &#x20;
5. **Conflicts & exits.** Spell out “no extractive exit” and mission-lock requirements (steward-ownership, purpose trusts) to align with Hearthstone.&#x20;
6. **Standards crosswalk.** Mainstream allocators will want a CSRD/ISSB/IRIS+/SDG mapping layer next to your Scorecard. (REF shows how you framed CSRD/SEC/B-Corp alignment—mirror that.)&#x20;
7. **Regionalization & FPIC ops.** You mention Indigenous partnership; add a concrete FPIC 2.0 checklist and BAZ-level adaptation notes.&#x20;
8. **Deal sourcing & pipeline.** Tell readers *where* to find investable GGF-aligned deals (BAZ pipelines, Transition Observatory, REF-certified firms). &#x20;

## High-leverage improvements (keeper list)

1. **RoR 1.0 spec (Appendix E+):**

   * Define RoR as a normalized index with three sub-scores: Financial (annualized IRR), Social (**Hearts** velocity per € invested, LMCI delta), Ecological (**Leaves** per € + BHI delta). Include time-discounting and a confidence interval from audit quality. Provide a worked example and a spreadsheet template. &#x20;
2. **Scorecard rubric & gates:**

   * Assign weights (e.g., 20% each), add *non-negotiable gates* (FPIC 2.0, Rights of Nature compliance, SHRU-type disarmament analogs where relevant), and set portfolio-level minimums (e.g., ≥3.5/5 in every domain).&#x20;
3. **Assurance protocol:**

   * Create a light “Impact Assurance” flow: self-report → community verification (BAZ/Recovery/ Safety councils where relevant) → independent auditor → spot audits by the Regeneration Audit Council. Publish results to the Digital Commons.  &#x20;
4. **Blended-finance patterns:**

   * Add 3 archetypes with diagrams:
     (a) Community Solar (grant + community equity + Transition Bond),
     (b) Forest Rematriation (guarantee + concessionary debt + Leaves),
     (c) Just-Transition SME Fund (first-loss philanthropic + senior debt + mission-locked equity). &#x20;
5. **Exit & governance clauses:**

   * Term-sheet addenda for: steward-ownership conversion on exit, community veto on mission drift, Reparations Index clawbacks, Hearts/Leaves covenants (minimum issuance/acceptance bands).&#x20;
6. **Standards crosswalk page:**

   * One matrix mapping each Scorecard item to CSRD/ISSB/SASB/IRIS+/SDGs + REF modules, to ease adoption in traditional IC memos. (Leverage REF’s regulatory alignment section.) &#x20;
7. **Engagement & escalation policy:**

   * Define how allocators use influence: time-bound improvement plans, public letters, voting policies, and a “Sundown pathway” if improvements stall. &#x20;
8. **Visuals that land:**

   * Keep the **radar chart**, and add (i) a **Regeneration-Return Frontier** (scatter of RoR vs. IRR), (ii) a **Hearts/Leaves flow map** per deal, and (iii) a **portfolio heatmap** by BAZ/sector. &#x20;
9. **Deal pipeline & data rooms:**

   * Point readers to a GGF “Venture Commons” listing (seeded with REF-aligned firms) and standardize an open data-room spec (Aurora-compliant), enabling faster diligence.&#x20;
10. **Negative screens & red lines:**

    * Add a checklist aligned with the Sundown Protocol (“do-not-invest” sectors/practices unless on a managed sundown plan), plus phase-out timelines.&#x20;

If you want, I can turn these into a compact **Appendix pack** (RoR spec + rubric + assurance flow + crosswalk + term-sheet riders) so the framework is plug-and-play for fund ICs.
