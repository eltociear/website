# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

This guide provides a comprehensive, iterative framework for establishing a Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ), a community-driven initiative for ecological and social regeneration aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) principles. It is designed to be adaptable for three scales: Homestead (<100 people ProtonMail), Village (100-5,000), and Bioregional (5,000+).

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: The six pillars are presented sequentially but are cyclical, allowing revisits as the community evolves.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead Model (<100)**: Focuses on informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures (e.g., cooperative), and integrated local economy.
  - **Village Model (100-5,000)**: Requires formal governance (e.g., citizen assemblies), public treasury, and Sovereign Co-Stewardship Agreements.
  - **Bioregional Model (5,000+)**: Involves sophisticated legal personhood, formal national government relationships, and multi-layered economy.
- **Toolkits**: Each pillar includes a modular toolkit with templates, guides, and case studies.

## Pre-Formation Assessment
- **BAZ Viability Assessment & Financial Planner**:
  - **Financial Runway Calculator**: Spreadsheet for assessing fiat expenses vs. regenerative income (e.g., AUBI stipends).
  - **Human Capital Assessment**: Template for mapping community skills (e.g., legal, medical, farming).
  - **Minimum Viable Community Checklist**: Guide for assessing community size and cohesion.
- **Budget**: $1,000-5,000 (initial workshops, materials, assessments).

## The Six Pillars

### Pillar 1: The Spark - Vision & Consensus Building
- Form a **Convening Circle** (5-10 diverse stakeholders: elders, youth, organizers, land experts).
- Host a **Community Dialogue** with powerful questions:
  - Connection to Place: What makes this place unique? What stories does it hold?
  - Vision: What does a thriving future look like in 50 years?
  - Pain Points: What are our deepest challenges?
  - Values: What principles and wisdom guide us?
- Distill a **Shared Vision Statement**: "We [action] so that [outcome]."  
  *Example*: "We steward our watershed's health, so future generations thrive in abundance."
- Form **Working Groups** for parallel pillar exploration.
- Celebrate milestones to maintain momentum.
- **Toolkit**: Community Dialogue Kit (facilitator guides, questions, icebreakers, ethical data synthesis).
- **Budget**: $500-2,000 (venues, materials, facilitation).

### Pillar 2: Finding Our Place - Defining the Bioregion
- **Ecological Mapping**:
  - Map watersheds, ecosystems, and geology with local experts.
- **Cultural Mapping**:
  - Honor Indigenous territories with FPIC 2.0 protocols.
  - Identify sacred/historical sites and foodsheds.
- **Synthesize Layers**: Overlay ecological and cultural maps in community workshops.
- Define the **Initial Zone of Governance**: A manageable starting area (e.g., watershed, valley).
- **Toolkit**: Bioregional Mapping for Beginners (GIS software, workshop guides, Indigenous protocols).
- **Budget**: $1,000-5,000 (mapping software, workshops, Indigenous consultation).

### Pillar 3: Building the Vessel - Legal & Institutional Scaffolding
- Form a **Legal Working Group** to map municipal, regional, and national laws.
- Draft the **BAZ Founding Charter**:
  - Vision, principles, governance, membership, GGF alignment, stewardship mandate.
- Establish **Legal Personhood**:
  - Options: Non-profit, cooperative, Indigenous partnership, or special district.
- Develop **Sovereign Co-Stewardship** strategy for state/municipal partnerships.
- Conduct **legal stress-testing** and establish a defense fund.
- **Stakeholder Engagement** ("Crawl, Walk, Run"):
  - Crawl: Manage internal systems (e.g., waste, care).
  - Walk: Pilot small municipal partnerships (e.g., gardens, cleanups).
  - Run: Propose larger roles (e.g., park management, elder care).
- **Toolkit**: BAZ Legal Primer (charter templates, case studies, legal guides, risk checklists).
- **Budget**: $8,500-38,500 (legal fees, incorporation, defense fund, software, workshops).
- **Legal Challenge Playbooks**:
  - **Alternative Currencies & Tax**: Register as non-profit, frame Hearts/Leaves as volunteer rewards, maintain fiat tax fund.
  - **Alternative Housing**: Research codes, propose pilot projects, document benefits.

### Pillar 4: Weaving the Council - Governance Formation
- Choose a **Three-Thread Governance Model**:
  - Indigenous: Elder councils, land-based consensus.
  - Deliberative: Citizen assemblies via sortition.
  - Sociocratic: Consent-based decisions, interconnected circles.
- Form **Founding Councils**:
  - Bioregional Stewardship Council (diverse, via Indigenous protocol/election/sortition).
  - Specialized Circles: Land & Water, Common Good, Hearth, Justice & Peace.
- Define **Roles**: Facilitators, scribes, delegates, external ambassadors.
- Establish **Decision-Making Protocols**:
  - FPIC 2.0 for major decisions, sociocratic consent for operations, radical transparency.
- Implement **Conflict Transformation Protocols**: Peer mediation, Justice & Peace Circle, restorative justice.
- **Toolkit**: Decentralized Governance Starter Pack (facilitation guides, by-laws, case studies, assembly guides, conflict templates).
- **Budget**: $2,000-8,000 (facilitation training, governance platforms).

### Pillar 5: Installing the OS - Core GGF Framework Integration
- Integrate the **Golden Triangle**:
  - **Treaty for Our Only Home**: Adopt Rights of Nature, Ecocide Law.
  - **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge**: Operationalize FPIC 2.0, connect to Earth Council.
