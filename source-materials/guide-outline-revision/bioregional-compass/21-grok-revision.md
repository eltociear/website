# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

The polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies—demands a radical reimagining of how we live. Within every bioregion lies the potential for communities rooted in reciprocity with the land and each other. The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide, aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF), is a practical blueprint for building regenerative futures. Whether a homestead, village, or bioregion, this guide offers a compass for creating systems that heal, connect, and endure.

## Quick Start Guide
For communities new to the BAZ model, start with these steps:
1. Form a Convening Circle of 5-10 diverse members.
2. Host a dialogue to define your shared vision.
3. Map your watershed and cultural landmarks.
4. Choose a simple legal structure (e.g., cooperative).
5. Start a pilot project (e.g., community garden).
6. Launch a small-scale AUBI payment system.
For a simplified entry point, see the **BAZ Starter Pack** below.

## BAZ Starter Pack: One-Page Roadmap
This concise roadmap helps small or new communities begin their BAZ journey without overwhelm, using three essential toolkits.

- **Step 1: Spark the Vision (Pillar 1)**  
  Form a Convening Circle (5-10 diverse members). Host a Community Dialogue to draft a Shared Vision Statement. *Toolkit*: Community Dialogue Kit (facilitator questions, icebreakers). *Budget*: $200-500. *Time*: 1-2 months.

- **Step 2: Map Your Place (Pillar 2)**  
  Create a basic watershed map with local input, honoring Indigenous territories via FPIC 2.0. *Toolkit*: Bioregional Mapping for Beginners (simple GIS tools, Indigenous protocols). *Budget*: $500-1,000. *Time*: 2-3 months.

- **Step 3: Start Small (Pillar 6)**  
  Launch a pilot project (e.g., community garden) and test AUBI Layer 1 payments for 5-10 households. *Toolkit*: First 100 Days with AUBI (treasury templates, payment guides). *Budget*: $1,000-5,000. *Time*: 3-6 months.

- **Next Steps**: Use milestones (e.g., 50% local food) to expand to other pillars, connect to the Bioregional Federation, and access the full guide for scaling.

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: Six pillars, cyclical, revisited as the community evolves.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead (<100)**: Informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures, local economy.
  - **Village (100-5,000)**: Formal governance with citizen assemblies, public treasury, co-stewardship agreements. Prevent "tyranny of structurelessness" by formalizing roles.
  - **Bioregional (5,000+)**: Sophisticated legal personhood, national relationships, multi-layered economy. Maintain democratic participation through nested councils and regular audits.
- **Managing Growth and Inter-BAZ Networks**:
  - **Growth Management Plan**: Homestead-to-Village transitions maintain core values via milestones (e.g., scaling governance, food sovereignty).
  - **Bioregional Federation**: 3-5 BAZs coordinate on shared resources (e.g., watersheds), mediate conflicts, develop specializations (e.g., food, technology), and appoint delegates to GGF Meta-Governance councils.
  - **Minimum Viable Network**: A regional cluster of 3-5 BAZs ensures resilience via strategic geographic planning.
- **A Guide for All Communities**: Rooted in Indigenous-led principles and Right Relationship, non-Indigenous groups form **Solidarity BAZs** with an **Ongoing Relationship Obligation** to the Earth Council or Indigenous networks for consultation and accountability.
- **Implementation Pathways**:
  - **Quick Implementation Pathway**: Pillars 0-2 and a pilot project within 6 months.
  - **Gradual Adoption Track**: Spread Pillars 0-6 over 5-7 years, prioritizing cohesion.
  - **Crisis Response Track**: Prioritize Pillars 0, 1, and 4 for rapid governance in urgent circumstances.
- **BAZ Formation Protocol Flowchart**:  
  1. **Assessment**: Conduct Pre-Formation Assessment (viability, skills, legal mapping).  
  2. **Initiation**: Form Convening Circle, draft vision (Pillar 1).  
  3. **Charter**: Develop Founding Charter, select legal structure (Pillar 3).  
  4. **Ratification**: Community-wide vote to adopt charter (Becoming a BAZ).  
  5. **Recognition**: Submit to Meta-Governance Council for GGF integration.
- **Phased Implementation Roadmap**:
  - **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)**: Pillars 0-2.
  - **Phase 2: System Setup (Years 2-4)**: Pillars 3-5.
  - **Phase 3: Launch & Iterate (Years 3-5+)**: Pillar 6.
- **Journey Map Infographic**: Visual roadmap from Pre-Formation Assessment to Six Pillars, culminating in “An Operational BAZ.”
