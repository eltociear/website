# **Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass**

## **Overview & Navigation**

### How to Use This Guide
- Iterative, non-linear process with feedback loops
- Three differentiated tracks: Homestead (<100), Village (100-5,000), Bioregional (5,000+)
- Scale-sensitive adaptations noted throughout

### Pre-Formation Assessment
