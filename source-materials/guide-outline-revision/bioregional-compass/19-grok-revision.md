# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

The polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies—demands a radical reimagining of how we live. Within every bioregion lies the potential for communities rooted in reciprocity with the land and each other. The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide, aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF), is a practical blueprint for building regenerative futures. Whether a homestead, village, or bioregion, this guide offers a compass for creating systems that heal, connect, and endure.

## Quick Start Guide
For communities new to the BAZ model, start with these steps:
1. Form a Convening Circle of 5-10 diverse members.
2. Host a dialogue to define your shared vision.
3. Map your watershed and cultural landmarks.
4. Choose a simple legal structure (e.g., cooperative).
5. Start a pilot project (e.g., community garden).
6. Launch a small-scale AUBI payment system.
Explore the full guide for detailed tools and strategies.

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: Six pillars, cyclical, revisited as the community evolves.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead (<100)**: Informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures, local economy.
  - **Village (100-5,000)**: Formal governance with citizen assemblies, public treasury, co-stewardship agreements. Prevent "tyranny of structurelessness" by formalizing roles and decision-making protocols.
  - **Bioregional (5,000+)**: Sophisticated legal personhood, national relationships, multi-layered economy. Maintain democratic participation through nested councils and prevent bureaucratic capture via regular community audits and transparency.
- **Managing Growth and Inter-BAZ Networks**:
  - **Growth Management Plan**: Homestead-to-Village transitions maintain core values via milestones (e.g., scaling governance, food sovereignty).
  - **Bioregional Federation**: Multiple BAZs coordinate regionally on shared resources (e.g., watersheds), mediate conflicts via neutral facilitators, develop complementary specializations (e.g., food production, technology), and appoint delegates to GGF Meta-Governance councils.
  - **Minimum Viable Network**: A regional cluster of 3-5 BAZs ensures resilience through resource sharing, mutual support, and strategic geographic planning along ecological corridors.
- **A Guide for All Communities**: Rooted in Indigenous-led principles and Right Relationship, this guide welcomes all communities. Non-Indigenous groups can form a **Solidarity BAZ** by committing to GGF principles and establishing an **Ongoing Relationship Obligation** with the Earth Council or regional Indigenous networks, involving regular consultation, resource sharing, and accountability to avoid cultural appropriation.
- **Implementation Pathways**:
  - **Quick Implementation Pathway**: For communities ready to start immediately, focus on Pillars 0-2 and a pilot project within 6 months.
  - **Gradual Adoption Track**: For communities needing to move slowly, spread Pillars 0-6 over 5-7 years, prioritizing community cohesion.
  - **Crisis Response Track**: For communities forming under urgent circumstances (e.g., climate displacement), prioritize Pillars 0, 1, and 4 for rapid governance setup.
- **Phased Implementation Roadmap**:
  - **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)**: Pillars 0-2.
  - **Phase 2: System Setup (Years 2-4)**: Pillars 3-5.
  - **Phase 3: Launch & Iterate (Years 3-5+)**: Pillar 6.
- **Journey Map Infographic**: A visual roadmap showing the Pre-Formation Assessment leading into the cyclical Six Pillars, arranged in a circle to emphasize their iterative nature. Key toolkits and playbooks branch off, culminating in “An Operational BAZ.”
- **Toolkits**: Modular resources with templates, guides, case studies, and infographics.
- **Multilingual Support**: Key sections in multiple languages, with visual aids for accessibility.

### Defining Your Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB)

## Becoming a BAZ: Graduation and Network Integration
After navigating the six pillars, your community is ready to transition from a formation project to a fully operational Bioregional Autonomous Zone. This graduation involves three key steps:

1. **Community Ratification**: Hold a community-wide vote to ratify your Founding Charter and officially launch the BAZ, marking a collective commitment to your shared vision.
2. **GGF Chartering & Recognition**: Submit your charter to the regional **Meta-Governance Council**. Upon acceptance, your BAZ gains official recognition within the GGF global network, granting representation and access to inter-BAZ support systems.
3. **Embracing the Journey**: Graduation is not an endpoint but the start of a living practice of stewardship, learning, and evolution, supported by the structures you’ve built.

## The Learning Journey: Support for Your BAZ
