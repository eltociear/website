# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

The polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies—demands a radical reimagining of how we live. Within every bioregion lies the potential for communities rooted in reciprocity with the land and each other. The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide, aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF), is a practical blueprint for building regenerative futures. Whether a homestead, village, or bioregion, this guide offers a compass for creating systems that heal, connect, and endure.

## Quick Start Guide
For communities new to the BAZ model, start with these steps:
1. Form a Convening Circle of 5-10 diverse members.
2. Host a dialogue to define your shared vision.
3. Map your watershed and cultural landmarks.
4. Choose a simple legal structure (e.g., cooperative).
5. Start a pilot project (e.g., community garden).
6. Launch a small-scale AUBI payment system.
Explore the full guide for detailed tools and strategies.

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: Six pillars, cyclical, revisited as the community evolves.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead (<100)**: Informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures, local economy.
  - **Village (100-5,000)**: Formal governance, public treasury, co-stewardship agreements.
  - **Bioregional (5,000+)**: Sophisticated legal personhood, national relationships, multi-layered economy.
- **Managing Growth and Inter-BAZ Networks**:
  - **Growth Management Plan**: Homestead-to-Village transitions maintain core values via milestones (e.g., scaling governance, food sovereignty).
  - **Bioregional Federation**: Multiple BAZs coordinate regionally, appointing delegates to GGF Meta-Governance councils.
- **A Guide for All Communities**: Rooted in Indigenous-led principles and Right Relationship, this guide welcomes all communities. Non-Indigenous groups can form a **Solidarity BAZ** by committing to GGF principles and seeking guidance from the **Earth Council** or regional Indigenous networks.
- **Phased Implementation Roadmap**:
  - **Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)**: Pillars 0-2.
  - **Phase 2: System Setup (Years 2-4)**: Pillars 3-5.
  - **Phase 3: Launch & Iterate (Years 3-5+)**: Pillar 6.
- **Toolkits**: Modular resources with templates, guides, case studies, and infographics.
- **Multilingual Support**: Key sections in multiple languages, with visual aids for accessibility.

### Defining Your Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB)
The MVB is your first milestone, a tangible target to shift from planning to action. Examples:
- Food sovereignty for 50% of residents.
- Functional Bioregional Stewardship Council.
- First AUBI Layer 1 payments.
Celebrate these wins to build momentum.
