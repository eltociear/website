# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

The polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies—demands a radical reimagining of how we live. The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide, aligned with the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF), is a comprehensive blueprint for building regenerative communities rooted in reciprocity with land and people. From homesteads to bioregions, this guide provides a practical and soulful path to a thriving future.

## Quick Start Guide
For communities new to the BAZ model, start with these steps:
1. Form a Convening Circle of 5-10 diverse members.
2. Host a dialogue to define your shared vision.
3. Map your watershed and cultural landmarks.
4. Choose a simple legal structure (e.g., cooperative).
5. Start a pilot project (e.g., community garden).
6. Launch a small-scale AUBI payment system.
For a simplified entry point, see the **BAZ Starter Pack** below.

## BAZ Starter Pack: One-Page Roadmap
This concise roadmap helps small or new communities begin without overwhelm, using three essential toolkits.

- **Step 1: Spark the Vision (Pillar 1)**  
  Form a Convening Circle (5-10 diverse members). Host a Community Dialogue to draft a Shared Vision Statement. *Toolkit*: Community Dialogue Kit (facilitator questions, icebreakers). *Budget*: $200-500. *Time*: 1-2 months.

- **Step 2: Map Your Place (Pillar 2)**  
  Create a basic watershed map with local input, honoring Indigenous territories via FPIC 2.0. *Toolkit*: Bioregional Mapping for Beginners (simple GIS tools, Indigenous protocols). *Budget*: $500-1,000. *Time*: 2-3 months.

- **Step 3: Start Small (Pillar 6)**  
  Launch a pilot project (e.g., community garden) and test AUBI Layer 1 payments for 5-10 households. *Toolkit*: First 100 Days with AUBI (treasury templates, payment guides). *Budget*: $1,000-5,000. *Time*: 3-6 months.

- **Next Steps**: Use milestones (e.g., 50% local food) to expand to other pillars, connect to the Bioregional Federation, and access the full guide for scaling.

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: Six pillars, cyclical, revisited as the community evolves.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead (<100)**: Informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures, local economy.
  - **Village (100-5,000)**: Formal governance with citizen assemblies, public treasury, co-stewardship agreements. Prevent "tyranny of structurelessness" by formalizing roles.
  - **Bioregional (5,000+)**: Sophisticated legal personhood, national relationships, multi-layered economy. Maintain democratic participation through nested councils and audits.
- **Managing Growth and Inter-BAZ Networks**:
  - **Growth Management Plan**: Homestead-to-Village transitions maintain core values via milestones.
  - **Bioregional Federation**: 3-5 BAZs coordinate on shared resources, mediate conflicts, develop specializations (e.g., food, technology), and appoint delegates to GGF Meta-Governance councils.
  - **Minimum Viable Network**: A regional cluster of 3-5 BAZs ensures resilience via strategic geographic planning.
- **A Guide for All Communities**: Rooted in Indigenous-led principles, non-Indigenous groups form **Solidarity BAZs** with an **Ongoing Relationship Obligation** to the Earth Council or Indigenous networks for consultation and accountability.
- **Implementation Pathways**:
  - **Quick Implementation Pathway**: Pillars 0-2 and a pilot within 6 months.
  - **Gradual Adoption Track**: Spread Pillars 0-6 over 5-7 years.
  - **Crisis Response Track**: Prioritize Pillars 0, 1, and 4 for rapid governance.

  2. **Initiation**: Form Convening Circle, draft vision (Pillar 1).
  3. **Charter**: Develop Founding Charter, select legal structure (Pillar 3).
  4. **Ratification**: Community-wide vote to adopt charter (Becoming a BAZ).
  5. **Recognition**: Submit to Meta-Governance Council for GGF integration.
