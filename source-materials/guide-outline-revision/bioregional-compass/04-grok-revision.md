# Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide: The Bioregional Compass

The world is unraveling under the weight of the polycrisis—climate collapse, social fragmentation, and extractive economies that prioritize profit over life. Yet, within every bioregion lies the potential for a new-old way of being human on Earth: communities rooted in place, thriving in reciprocity with the land and each other. The Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Formation Guide is a recipe for these communities—a practical, adaptable blueprint for weaving regenerative futures. Whether you are a small homestead dreaming of sovereignty, a village seeking resilience, or a bioregion ready to redefine governance, this guide offers a compass for building systems that heal, connect, and endure.

## Overview & Navigation

### How to Use This Guide
- **Iterative Process**: The six pillars are presented sequentially but are cyclical, encouraging revisits as your community learns and grows.
- **Scale-Sensitive Adaptations**:
  - **Homestead Model (<100 people)**: Informal/sociocratic governance, simple legal structures (e.g., cooperative), and integrated local economy.
  - **Village Model (100-5,000)**: Formal governance (citizen assemblies), public treasury, and Sovereign Co-Stewardship Agreements.
  - **Bioregional Model (5,000+)**: Sophisticated legal personhood, formal national government relationships, multi-layered economy.
- **Toolkits**: Each pillar includes modular resources with templates, guides, and case studies to support implementation.

### Defining Your Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB)
The Minimum Viable BAZ (MVB) is your community's first major milestone—a tangible, achievable target that marks the transition from planning to action. Examples include:
- Achieving food sovereignty for 50% of residents through local farms and foodsheds.
- Establishing a fully functional Bioregional Stewardship Council with diverse representation.
- Launching the first AUBI Layer 1 payments to ensure economic security for all members.
Celebrate these early wins to build momentum and demonstrate the BAZ’s potential.

## Pre-Formation Assessment
