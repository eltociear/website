**CONFIDENTIAL WORKING PAPER – PROTOCOL OMEGA (Final Bulletproof Edition)**  
**Date:** 4 January 2026  
**Classification:** Eyes-only – Head of State / Vice-Premier / Secretary level and above  
**Origin:** Joint Swiss–Qatari–Singapore escrow & drafting cell  

### The Deal in One Brutal Paragraph  
Russia gets full sanctions removal within 24 months and permanent energy dominance over Europe.  
Ukraine gets an unbreakable, triple-locked $150 bn sovereign defense endowment (capitalised upfront) plus $50 bn/year reconstruction.  
China becomes the lead builder of the new Eastern Eurasian Stability Corridor and locks in 50-year returns.  
The West ends the war, gets 15 years of cheap Russian gas, and pivots to Asia.  
The entire sequence is automatic, escrow-triggered, and legally bomb-proof. No one has to trust anyone.

### The Four Pillars – Now Legally and Politically Unassailable

#### Pillar 1 – Joint Development Condominium (JDC) 2026–2041  
Territory: All land east of the February 2022 line + Crimea

Legal & Governance Framework  
- Dual citizenship/passport regime – residents choose freely.  
- Existing property registrations frozen exactly as they are today.  
- Day-to-day governance: current local councils continue.  
- **JDC Development Authority (JDA)** – rotating Ukrainian/Russian co-chair + professional Singaporean CEO (World Bank secondment). Mandate strictly limited to reconstruction contracts and passport registry.

Security & Law  
- Total demilitarisation except light police.  
- **JDC Legal Protocol (Annex 6)**: Ukrainian criminal and civil code remains the sole de jure legal basis for the entire zone.  
- **Hybrid Court of First Resort**: panels of 1 Ukrainian + 1 Russian + 1 Swiss/Singaporean judge for all serious crimes and interstate disputes. Prevents lawlessness without creating a new sovereign entity.

#### Pillar 2 – Eurasian Reconstruction & Energy Transition Fund (ERETF)

Board (voting shares)  
Russia 25 % ∙ EU 25 % ∙ China 20 % ∙ United States 15 % ∙ World Bank 15 %

Capitalisation  
- Russia: 35 % of Europe-bound gas/electricity credited at full market price as founding donor contribution.  
- China: USD 140 bn 50-year concessional loans with **priority contractor status limited to green physical infrastructure** (solar, rail, transmission lines).  
- EU/G7/Gulf: matching grants/loans.

Critical Digital Infrastructure Protocol  
All government networks, telecom backbones, and energy SCADA systems are tendered separately under Five-Eyes-approved security standards. Chinese firms may bid but have no priority.

#### Pillar 3 – Permanent Armed Neutrality + Triple-Locked Capacity

Ukraine amends constitution to permanent neutrality (no NATO, no foreign bases).

Two irrevocable, untouchable funds capitalised within 90 days:

A. **Ukrainian Defense Sovereignty Endowment (UDSE)** – USD 150 bn  
- Legally separate entity **“Ukrainian Peace Fund SA”** incorporated in Singapore, physical servers in Qatar.  
- Triple-lock board: Switzerland (operations) + Qatar (finance) + Singapore (legal) – any change requires unanimous consent.  
- Protected by pre-agreed UNSC resolution declaring interference an act of aggression.

B. **Verifiable Capabilities Treaty (VCT) – Annex 1 (revised)**  
- All Western systems delivered with factory-level tamper-evident hardware locks.  
- Spot inspections unlimited (not twice-yearly).  
- Standing **Technology Review Committee** (US, EU, Ukraine, Russia, Swiss chair) meets quarterly to approve new defensive systems by consensus → prevents obsolescence and hidden offensive upgrades.

#### Pillar 4 – Automatic Sanctions Exit (no political discretion)

| Day 1–75  | UDSE fully capitalised (USD 150 bn) + first Chinese loan tranche in triple-locked escrow            | Swiss National Bank + Qatar + Singapore |
| Day 76–90 | Ukrainian Rada passes constitutional neutrality amendment                                          | OSCE special mission                   |
| Day 91    | Escrow releases first USD 20 bn to Ukraine; first-tier sanctions lifted automatically              | Automatic smart-contract trigger      |
| Day 100   | JDA begins operations; gas metering starts; second-tier sanctions lifted automatically            | Automatic                              |
