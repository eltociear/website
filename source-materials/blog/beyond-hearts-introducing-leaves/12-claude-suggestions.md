This revision addresses most of my previous concerns and is much stronger. The concrete walkthrough with Maria's example, the clearer verification process, and the practical "Getting Started" section make the concept much more accessible. However, there are still a few areas that need attention before full drafting:

**Remaining structural issues:**

1. **Economic credibility gap**: The "$100 for 100 Hearts" example oversimplifies what would be complex economic mechanics. You need to address:
   - Who determines that 100 Leaves = $100 worth of ecological value?
   - How does the Community Treasury maintain stable exchange rates without massive capital reserves?
   - What prevents inflation if Leaves are "abundant & collaborative"?

2. **Verification details still vague**: While the Community Weaver concept helps, "geotagged photos and a simple checklist" won't satisfy skeptics about a reforestation project's long-term success or a garden's actual ecological impact.

3. **Missing failure modes**: The "too good to be true" paragraph acknowledges challenges but doesn't address specific risks like:
   - Gaming the system through fake projects
   - Community Weavers becoming corrupt gatekeepers
   - Economic manipulation by bad actors

**Specific suggestions for improvement:**

1. **Replace the economic walkthrough** with a more realistic example showing smaller amounts and acknowledging complexity: "Maria's group might earn 50 Leaves worth approximately $25-50, depending on local economic conditions and the project's verified impact."

2. **Add a brief "Safeguards" section** mentioning randomized audits, community oversight, and appeals processes.

3. **Include realistic timeline expectations**: "This system is being tested in pilot communities, with full rollout expected over 5-10 years as we refine the technology and economic models."

4. **Strengthen the technology section** by acknowledging current limitations: "While we're building toward full smartphone accessibility, current pilots rely on simplified web forms and SMS updates."

The outline now has good narrative flow and addresses accessibility concerns, but the economic mechanics need more honest complexity before this will be credible to thoughtful readers. Consider whether your target audience is early adopters who'll accept some hand-waving, or broader skeptics who need more rigorous explanations.
