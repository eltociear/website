Looking at this blog post outline, I see several strengths alongside some areas that need refinement before full drafting.

**What works well:**
- The progression from Hearts to Leaves creates logical continuity
- The regenerative loop concept is compelling and well-visualized
- Concrete examples of Leaf-earning activities are tangible
- The inclusion of verification processes addresses credibility concerns

**Key areas needing improvement:**

**1. Technical complexity vs. accessibility gap**
The outline jumps between simple explanations and complex governance structures without adequate bridging. For example, you mention "global councils," "digital justice bodies," and "Community Weavers" without explaining how an average reader would actually interact with these systems.

**2. Economic mechanics need clearer explanation**
The conversion between Leaves and Hearts, and then Hearts to national currency, is mentioned but not clearly explained. Readers will want to understand:
- What determines exchange rates?
- Who sets the "stable, guaranteed rate"?
- How does this avoid inflation or manipulation?

**3. Verification credibility concerns**
While you address verification, the explanation feels somewhat hand-wavy. "AI-analyzed satellite imagery" for reforestation is plausible, but how do you verify community gardens or coastal restoration quality? The "multi-layered process" needs more concrete detail.

**4. Missing critical context**
- No mention of scale (local pilot vs. global rollout)
- Limited discussion of how this relates to existing environmental programs
- Unclear relationship to regulatory frameworks

**Specific suggestions for revision:**

1. **Add a "Getting Started" section** that walks through exactly how someone would begin earning their first Leaves
2. **Simplify the governance language** - replace "global council" and "digital justice body" with more accessible terms
3. **Include a realistic example** of conversion rates and actual economic impact
4. **Address the "too good to be true" factor** by acknowledging challenges upfront

The outline has strong bones but needs more practical grounding before full drafting. Consider testing the core concepts with people unfamiliar with your broader framework to identify remaining clarity gaps.
