This revised outline is significantly stronger and much more ready for full drafting. You've addressed most of my concerns effectively:

## Major Improvements

**Clear Audience and Purpose**: The subtitle and opening establish this as a practical guide for people facing gridlock, with concrete examples they'll recognize. The city council scenario is relatable and specific.

**Better Structure**: Starting with the pain point (gridlock) before introducing the solution creates natural reader engagement. The progression from problem → tool → walkthrough → action feels logical.

**Practical Focus**: The 15-minute exercise and downloadable template make this immediately actionable. The FAQ addresses real implementation concerns.

**Appropriate Scope**: At 7 minutes reading time, the piece can adequately cover the Canvas methodology without trying to solve everything.

## Minor Refinements Before Drafting

**Section 4 Table Formatting**: The pole mapping table is useful but may not render well in all blog formats. Consider describing it in text with the table as visual support.

**Power Check Integration**: The power and cultural checks are crucial but feel tacked on. Consider weaving these warnings throughout rather than relegating them to the end.

**Evidence Balance**: You mention South Africa and Warren County as precedents, but readers might want more direct examples of the Canvas being used. Consider noting this is a new tool synthesizing proven approaches.

**FAQ Positioning**: The FAQ covers important objections but comes late. Consider moving one key objection (like "when to use this vs. advocacy") earlier to address reader skepticism sooner.

## Ready for Drafting With These Approaches

1. **Lead with the city council scenario** - it's concrete and engaging
2. **Integrate safeguards naturally** rather than treating them as afterthoughts
3. **Use the table as a visual aid** but describe the process in text
4. **Address one major objection early** to build credibility
5. **Keep the practical tone** throughout - this works well

The outline now strikes the right balance between accessibility and depth. The Canvas methodology is clearly explained, the walkthrough demonstrates practical application, and the call to action gives readers concrete next steps.

You're ready to begin full drafting. The structure is solid, the scope is manageable, and the practical focus will serve readers well. Focus on maintaining the conversational tone while ensuring the Canvas process is crystal clear through both description and example.
