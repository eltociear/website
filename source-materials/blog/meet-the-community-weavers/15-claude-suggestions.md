This revision addresses most of my major concerns effectively. The restructuring significantly improves clarity and emotional resonance. Here are my remaining observations:

## Substantial Improvements

**The flow now works.** Starting with the human archetype (hidden weavers) before diving into systems is much stronger. The reader can now see themselves in the role before confronting the technical scaffolding.

**The Leo narrative has emotional texture.** Sarah's "relief is palpable," the elder "lights up," the Friday session shows real tension—these moments make the work feel human rather than administrative.

**The Hearts/Love Ledger distinction is clearer.** The photo album analogy is effective. The explicit statement that "Actions on the Love Ledger don't directly convert to Hearts" removes the confusion.

**The tiered pathway solves the accessibility problem.** Separating Community Steward (entry point) from Certified Weaver (professional track) respects that people are already doing this work informally.

## Remaining Issues to Address

**1. The compensation explanation is still vague**

You clarified that Certified Weavers earn "AUBI Layer 2 Bonuses in Hearts... typically equivalent to a part-time living wage, paid monthly based on validated contributions."

But questions remain:
- What's a "typical" amount in concrete terms? (Even a range like "500-1000 Hearts monthly" helps)
- Who validates contributions, and how often?
- What happens during the Community Steward phase—do they receive anything beyond the micro-grant?

This matters because potential Weavers need to assess economic viability.

**2. The "hidden weaver" identification still has gaps**

You state it's "a community nomination process, not data-mining" and focuses on invisible care work. This is better, but the outline doesn't explain:
- Who facilitates the nomination process initially (if there's no Weaver yet)?
- How nominations are validated or contested
- What prevents popularity contests or factional nominations

Consider adding one sentence about the specific mechanism (e.g., "facilitated by a neutral GGF catalyst team" or "using a structured community assembly").

**3. The failure vignette is valuable but incomplete**

Leo's failed restorative circle is a strong addition. But the outline says "The next time, Leo involved co-Weavers and focused on listening first." This implies success was inevitable with the right technique.

Real failure often requires:
- Acknowledging when repair isn't possible yet
- Stepping back from facilitation entirely
- Accepting that some conflicts need external mediation

Consider showing what Leo did when people still left angry after the second attempt—did he escalate to the Digital Justice Tribunal? Pause the process? This would build credibility.

**4. Section 4's analogy slightly undercuts Section 3**

The photo album analogy for Love Ledger vs. Hearts is clear, but it's presented abstractly. Consider anchoring it to Leo's week:

"Remember Tuesday, when Sarah received a Gratitude Token for helping a neighbor? That recognition lived on the Love Ledger—capturing connection without monetizing it. But when that small parent group formalized into a Community Provider offering childcare services, they began earning Hearts to cover real costs like supplies and space rental."

This grounds the abstraction in the narrative readers just experienced.

**5. The FAQ answers are too brief**

Each FAQ response is one sentence. Given that these address major concerns (crisis response, cultural sensitivity, success metrics), they deserve 2-3 sentences with a concrete example. For instance:

"*How do Weavers handle crises?* Via Stabilization Mode—focusing on safe spaces and basic needs first, then building toward regeneration. In a post-flood community, this might mean Third Places become distribution centers for supplies before hosting restorative circles weeks later."

## Minor Polish Needed

**The "Reader-Centered Hook" in Section 2 is repeated from Section 1.** Since Section 1 now does this work ("the natural connectors in our own neighborhoods"), Section 2 can start directly with the definition.

**The table in Section 2 is strong but could be reordered.** Consider: Focus → Power Source → Goal → Measure of Success. This flows from "what they do" to "how they do it" to "what success looks like."

**Section 5's tone shifts awkwardly.** It begins with "Weaving is Messy" (casual, human) then immediately lists anti-patterns with clinical language (saviorism, factionalization). Consider keeping the conversational tone: "Sometimes Weavers burn out from taking on too much. Sometimes communities game the system..."

**The conclusion's timeline is oddly specific.** "In three months... in a year... in five years" implies guaranteed outcomes. Soften this to "In three months, you might see... In a year, some communities have built..." This acknowledges variability without deflating hope.

## The Core Purpose Question—Resolved

You've clarified this is primarily an **inspiration piece** (to help readers "recognize the weaver in themselves") with secondary goals of **recruitment** and **explanation**. The revision successfully prioritizes inspiration—the pain point opening, Leo's emotional arc, and the accessible entry point all serve this.

The remaining technical detail is now appropriate for readers who want to understand the systems that support Weaving, without overwhelming those who just want to start.

## Verdict: Nearly Ready for Full Drafting

This revision transforms a dense technical document into an accessible, emotionally resonant introduction to Community Weaving. The core structure is sound.

Before drafting, I'd recommend:

1. **Add 2-3 sentences** clarifying compensation mechanics and nomination process
2. **Expand the FAQ** to 2-3 sentences each with concrete examples
3. **Apply the minor polish** noted above (remove repeated hook, reorder table, soften conclusion timeline)
4. **Ground the Section 4 analogy** in Leo's specific experiences from Section 3

With these adjustments, you'll have an outline ready for full drafting that balances inspiration, practical guidance, and systems context—without losing readers in either abstraction or emotional manipulation.

Would you like me to draft revised text for any of these specific sections?
