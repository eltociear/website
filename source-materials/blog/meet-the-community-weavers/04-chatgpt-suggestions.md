Absolutely, Björn — this outline is already strong. Here are focused, high-leverage upgrades to make it tighter, clearer, and more aligned with your supporting frameworks.

# Quick wins (clarity & flow)

1. Open with a crisp promise + “What you’ll learn”
   Right after the subtitle, add a 2–3 sentence value-promise and 3 bullets (“What you’ll learn”) in plain language. Keep acronyms out of the first screen.
   *Why:* lowers cognitive load for general readers.

2. Keep the Hearts ↔ Love Ledger split crystal clear
   Throughout, consistently state: **Hearts = paid, formal services via chartered Community Providers; Love Ledger = non-monetized recognition of informal care**. This is how your frameworks now specify the flow, including the Hearts Treasury redemption path.  
   *Where to tweak in the outline:* Sections 3 and 5 (functions, training/comp), plus any place you imply Love Ledger “pays.” Use a simple inset graphic “Two Parallel Channels” (see Visuals).

3. Reframe “Weaver” as a reader-centered role
   Lead with: “If you’re the person who already connects people and gets things moving, this role turns that invisible work into a supported vocation.” Then give a 1-paragraph definition and a 4-row “What it is / What it isn’t” table (you already started this—great). Tie success to **LMCI** movement, not program size.  

4. Swap technocracy for tangible tools
   Name the on-ramps readers can picture: **Community Care Card**, **Heartstarter**, **Community Work App**, **SMS fallback**. Briefly say what each does. (They’re already present in the frameworks—surface them here.)  

5. Give the narrative stakes in “Week in the Life”
   Add a mini-arc: a tension > action > outcome. E.g., “puzzling anomaly → restorative conversation → bakery stays in network + volunteers become a Parent Coop that qualifies as a Community Provider.” Close with one concrete metric shift (e.g., “+12 weekly childcare hours, +0.3 LMCI subscore”). 

# Structural refinements (suggested outline v2)

1. **Hook & Plain-Language Primer**

   * 2-sentence promise + “What you’ll learn.”
   * 60-second primer: Hearts (paid) vs Love Ledger (recognition). Include micro-diagram.  

2. **What is a Community Weaver?**

   * Short definition; “What it is / isn’t” table.
   * Success = community self-organization + LMCI uptick, not budget growth. 

3. **Three Core Functions (rename for verbs)**

   * **Welcome & Bridge** (access/on-ramps: Care Card, SMS onboarding, Heartstarter).  
   * **Guard the Gift** (ethics/restorative checks; anomaly → conversation, not punishment). 
   * **Weave the Fabric** (listening, convening circles, connecting → LMCI drivers). 

4. **A Week in the Life (narrative arc with numbers)**

   * Monday (onboard bakery as **Community Provider**; why providers matter: Hearts redemption at Treasury).  
   * Wednesday (offline Care Card session at elder home → Love Ledger entries). 
   * Friday (gratitude-ring flag → restorative circle → norm reset). 
   * Close with a tiny dashboard: “+X Hearts circulation via providers; +Y informal gratitudes; LMCI sub-index ↑Z.” 

5. **Pathway to Becoming a Weaver**

   * **Signals:** consistent, community-validated gratitude on Love Ledger = talent discovery. 
   * **Training (6 months):** Hearts mechanics, Love Ledger operations, restorative facilitation, Indigenous protocols, LMCI basics. 
   * **Compensation:** AUBI **Layer 2 bonuses in Hearts**; who pays and how (providers → Treasury). 
   * **Accountability:** term-limits, community feedback on-ledger. 

6. **Anti-Patterns & Safeguards (new, short)**

   * Saviorism, over-centralization, burnout, gaming.
   * Mitigations: rotation, peer supervision, restorative tools, anomaly triage protocol.  

7. **Starter Kit: Begin in Your Town**

   * Download: **Weaver Quickstart** (Care Card PDF, 90-minute circle script, SMS guide), **Provider Charter Template**, **Treasury FAQ**. (All terms match frameworks.)  

8. **Conclusion: The Human Infrastructure**

   * Reiterate: relationships first, algorithms second; invitation to raise a hand.

# Visual upgrades (lightweight but vivid)

* **Two Parallel Channels** (one graphic):
  Hearts (formal, paid via Providers → Treasury redemption) | Love Ledger (informal, non-monetized recognition → LMCI).  

* **Weaver Ecosystem Map**: Weaver in center → People, Providers, BAZ Council, Treasury—arrows show specific interactions (e.g., “trains provider,” “facilitates circle,” “flags anomalies”). 

* **Micro-dashboard in the vignette**: 3 metrics tied to LMCI and Hearts flow. 

# Consistency checks to apply while editing

* Use “**Community Provider**” (chartered) for the formal service entity; reserve “Community Work Team” for the organizational form—note your latest framing treats teams as a *type* of Provider. 
* Keep “**Hearts Treasury**” as the redemption/stability anchor; don’t imply P2P cash-out. 
* Keep **Love Ledger non-monetized**; call out “Gratitude Tokens” only as recognition, not currency. 

# Copy polish (plug-and-play)

* **Alt title options**

  * “Meet the Community Weavers: Turning Invisible Care into a Supported Vocation”
  * “The Human Interface of a Regenerative Economy: Community Weavers”
  * “From Good Neighbors to Weavers: How Communities Come Alive”

* **Meta description (≤160 chars)**
  “Meet the Community Weaver—the trust-builder who onboards neighbors, safeguards ethics, and connects Hearts with the Love Ledger to strengthen local life.”

* **Social snippets (X/LinkedIn)**

  * “Systems don’t change communities—people do. Meet the Community Weavers who turn care, trust, and local projects into a living, regenerative economy.”
  * “Hearts (paid services) + Love Ledger (recognition) only work when someone connects the dots. That someone is the Community Weaver.”

# Optional additions (if you have space)

* **Mini-FAQ**

  * *Is this paid?* Yes—Weavers receive AUBI Layer-2 Hearts bonuses; formal services are paid via Providers that redeem at the Treasury. 
  * *Do I need to be techy?* No—SMS and paper Care Cards are supported.  
  * *How do I start?* Begin with a 90-minute Convening Circle + Care Card pilot, then charter your first Provider and connect to the Treasury. 

If you’d like, I can take your current draft and apply these edits directly—tightening copy, inserting the visuals, and reshuffling sections to the v2 outline.
