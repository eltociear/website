I've reviewed the blog post outline and supporting frameworks. The structure is solid and comprehensive, but there are several areas where clarity, flow, and practical accessibility could be strengthened. Here are my substantive suggestions:

## Structural & Flow Issues

**1. The "60-Second Primer" is too dense**
The primer tries to explain three complex systems (Social Fabric, Hearts, Love Ledger) in one breath. Consider splitting this into:
- A true 60-second version focusing *only* on the Community Weaver role
- A separate "System Context" section for readers who want the full picture

**2. Section flow feels inverted**
You introduce the technical systems before explaining what Weavers actually *do*. Consider reordering:
- Hook → What is a Weaver (Section 2) → What they do day-to-day (Section 4) → The systems they work with (Section 1 primer) → How to become one (Section 5)

**3. The "Week in the Life" needs more emotional texture**
Leo's week reads like a task list. Each day should show a *human problem* being resolved, not just activities being completed. For example, Tuesday currently says "Leo uses Love Ledger data to connect a young parent..." but doesn't show us the parent's isolation or the relief when connection happens.

## Content Gaps & Clarifications

**4. The Love Ledger / Hearts distinction is confusing**
You state the Love Ledger uses "Gratitude Tokens" for non-monetized recognition, but then Leo logs care acts on it that seem to feed into Hearts eligibility. The outline needs a clearer explanation of:
- What actions go on Love Ledger vs. Hearts
- How they relate (or don't) to each other
- Why someone would care about Gratitude Tokens if they're non-monetized

**5. Missing: What happens when Weaving fails?**
Section 6 lists anti-patterns but doesn't show what failure looks like in practice or how to recover. A brief case study of a failed Weaving attempt and the lessons learned would strengthen credibility.

**6. The "hidden weavers" identification raises concerns**
You state the Love Ledger identifies "hidden weavers" through their "consistent history of authentic, informal care acts." But who validates these acts are "authentic"? This could inadvertently favor:
- Those with time to log activities
- Those comfortable with technology
- Those whose care work is visible (vs. invisible domestic labor)

Consider addressing how you prevent bias in this identification process.

## Practical Accessibility Issues

**7. The training requirements seem heavy**
A 6-month certification might be appropriate for formal Weavers, but the outline positions this as the *entry point* for community members who are already doing the work informally. Consider:
- A lighter "Community Steward" track for locals continuing their existing work
- The full certification for those who want to professionalize or work across communities

**8. The "Starter Kit" is buried**
Section 8's call-to-action with the "3-3-3 MVP Kit" is excellent but arrives too late. Consider making this prominent earlier as a "you can start now" element.

**9. Missing: How Weavers actually get paid**
You mention AUBI Layer 2 Bonuses but don't explain the practical mechanics. How much? How often? What if the community can't pay yet? This ambiguity could deter potential Weavers.

## Technical & Terminology Issues

**10. Jargon overload**
Terms like "Sovereign Selves," "Generative Conflict," "Kintsugi Protocol," "Bioregional Autonomous Zones" pile up without adequate plain-language translation. The outline needs consistent use of both technical terms (for precision) and accessible alternatives (for inclusion).

**11. Cross-references are excessive**
Nearly every paragraph has [cite: XX-grok-revision.md] notations. While rigor is good, this makes the outline feel like a legal document rather than an inspiring blog post. Consider consolidating citations or moving detailed sourcing to footnotes.

## Tone & Audience Concerns

**12. The target audience is unclear**
The outline says "general audience, community organizers, social workers, facilitators" but the density of systems thinking and governance frameworks suggests this is really for:
- Policy implementers
- Academic audiences  
- GGF ecosystem insiders

If you truly want general audiences, the post needs significant simplification. If you want implementers, own that and deepen the practical guidance.

**13. The conclusion promises too much**
"Making regeneration relational and resilient" is inspiring but vague. What *specific* change should readers expect in their community after 3 months? 1 year? 5 years? Ground the vision in concrete milestones.

## Minor Fixes

- The "Mini-FAQ" at the end is helpful but too brief—expand or integrate answers into main sections
- The comparison table in Section 2 could add a "Real-World Example" column for each role type
- Friday's "breakthrough understanding" in Leo's week feels deus ex machina—show the facilitation technique that created the shift

## The Core Question

The outline is technically comprehensive but I'm uncertain about its *purpose*. Is this meant to:
- **Inspire** people to recognize themselves as Weavers?
- **Recruit** people into formal training?
- **Explain** the role to GGF stakeholders?
- **Document** the system for implementers?

The outline tries to do all four, which dilutes its impact. I'd recommend choosing one primary goal and restructuring accordingly. If inspiration is primary, cut 40% of the technical detail and add more stories. If documentation is primary, own the density and add implementation checklists.

**Bottom line**: The intellectual architecture is sound, but the outline needs significant revision for clarity, emotional resonance, and audience focus before full drafting. Would you like me to suggest a specific restructure based on a chosen primary purpose?
