This revision is significantly stronger and much closer to being ready for drafting. You've addressed most of my earlier concerns with concrete improvements:

## Major Improvements
- **Cleaner introduction** that builds concepts gradually rather than front-loading theory
- **Much better concrete example** with Maria's week-long walkthrough showing actual user interactions
- **Expanded ethics section** that addresses failure scenarios and includes restorative responses
- **Simplified technology section** with stakeholder details relegated to a footnote
- **Stronger governance connection** with the community kitchen example showing how LMCI data translates to resource decisions

## Remaining Issues to Address

**The "day in the life" section (3) feels disconnected** from the mechanics section (4). Consider merging these or making the transition smoother, since they cover similar ground from different angles.

**The governance example needs more specificity.** The community kitchen scenario is good but vague. How exactly does "high elder care but low intergenerational activities" translate to funding decisions? What's the actual decision-making process?

**Missing anticipation of deeper skepticism.** Your FAQ handles surface concerns, but readers will wonder: What prevents communities from collectively gaming the system for more resources? How do you handle cultural differences in what constitutes "care"? What about communities that simply reject this approach?

**The "bridge to Work with Purpose" claim (Function 3, Section 5) lacks explanation.** How exactly does Love Ledger history qualify someone as a Community Provider? This connection feels important but underdeveloped.

## Minor Polish Needed

- The footnote system creates some awkward reading flow
- Some jargon still creeps in (e.g., "BAZ nodes") that could be simplified for general readers
- The visual elements list could be more integrated into the text rather than appended

## Recommendation

You're ready to draft, but consider these refinements during the writing process rather than further outline revision. The structure is sound and you have good concrete examples. The remaining issues are execution details that will be easier to address in full prose than in outline form.

The piece now has a clear narrative arc and balances accessibility with depth. Start drafting and refine these specific points as you go.
