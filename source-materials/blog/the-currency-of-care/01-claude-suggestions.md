Let me analyze this blog post outline based on the white paper content. The outline shows strong understanding of the white paper's key innovations and takes a more humble, research-oriented approach than typical advocacy pieces. Here are some thoughts:

## Strengths of the Outline

**Research Framing**: The outline correctly positions this as a research hypothesis rather than a proven solution, which makes it much more credible and intellectually honest.

**Systemic Acupuncture Metaphor**: This is compelling and differentiates the approach from both traditional welfare and simpler alternatives. It communicates the core insight about targeting root causes rather than symptoms.

**BAZ Starter Pack**: The practical implementation pathway makes this feel actionable rather than purely theoretical. Starting with 5-10 people and a shared bank account is much more approachable than launching a complete alternative economy.

**Hearts/Love Ledger Distinction**: This is crucial for addressing the "commodifying relationships" objection. The outline properly separates infrastructure support (Hearts) from recognition (Love Ledger).

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Simplify the Currency Introduction**: The outline introduces both Hearts and Leaves, but the white paper focuses primarily on Hearts. Consider focusing solely on Hearts in this post to avoid cognitive overload, then introduce Leaves in a follow-up post about ecological systems.

**Strengthen the UBI Bridge**: The white paper positions AUBI as building on UBI rather than replacing it. The outline could better emphasize that this is "UBI Plus" rather than an alternative to UBI, which will feel less threatening to UBI advocates.

**Add Concrete Numbers**: The white paper includes specific details like "70% fiat, 30% Hearts" and "300 Hearts monthly alongside $700." Including some concrete examples would help readers visualize how this works practically.

**Address Scale Skepticism Earlier**: The outline saves scaling questions for the conclusion, but readers will have scale concerns from the beginning. Consider addressing "How does this get beyond a neighborhood experiment?" earlier in the piece.

**Clarify the Global Research Program**: The outline mentions joining the research program but doesn't clearly explain what that means practically. What would a reader actually do to participate?

## Structural Suggestions

**Consider Reorganizing Section 4**: The "How It Could Work" section might be more effective if it shows the progression from individual story to systems level, rather than jumping into the BAZ Starter Pack mechanics. Perhaps start with Maria's experience, then zoom out to show how her community built their system.

**Strengthen the Bridge to Action**: The conclusion invites people to "join the inquiry" but could be more specific about different types of participation. What does this look like for a parent, a small business owner, a local government official, or a researcher?

The outline captures the white paper's intellectual rigor while maintaining narrative appeal. The key will be execution—ensuring the final post feels grounded in both emotional resonance and research credibility rather than utopian speculation.
