Björn "Pwnytale" K. Holmström:
Here's our blog post system. Is it good to create a similar system for the updates? Or should we make it even smaller with all updates in one file (one per language)? 

Gemini:
No, you should not create a separate system for updates. That would be a classic violation of your own "Minimum Viable Governance" principle.

Your current blog system is already a sophisticated, multi-language content management system. Replicating it would be a significant amount of work.

The simplest, most effective, and most "GGF-aligned" solution is to use your existing blog system and add a "Category" filter.
