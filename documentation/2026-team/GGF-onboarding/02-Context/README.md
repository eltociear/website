# Context & Background

This folder contains the theoretical and philosophical foundations of GGF. You don't need to read all of this immediately - it's reference material for when you need deeper understanding.

## What's Here

### **architecture-of-the-open-hand.pdf** (English, 20 pages, ~45 min)
**Why we fight and how we design peace**

The philosophical core of GGF in 6 parts:
- **Part I:** The innocent question (why is there war?)
- **Part II:** The diagnosis (the epistemic error of separation)
- **Part III:** The trap (when good intentions meet bad incentives)
- **Part IV:** The solution (trans-rational architecture) ← **Read this part if you read nothing else**
- **Part V:** The transition pathway (from here to there)
- **Part VI:** Conclusion (the new answer to the child)

**When to read:**
- When someone asks "but WHY does GGF exist?"
- When you need to understand the meta-framework
- When grant applications ask for "theoretical foundation"
- When you're writing persuasive text and need the right words

**What you'll get:**
- Understanding of why GGF isn't just another NGO
- The logic behind Hearts, BAZs, and the Treaty
- How to explain this to skeptics without sounding utopian

**Focus on:** Part IV "The Solution" - it's the most concrete and useful for operational work.

### **architecture-of-the-open-hand-svenska.pdf** (Swedish, 20 pages, ~45 min)
Same content as above, in Swedish.

**When to use:**
- When writing Swedish grant applications
- When pitching to Swedish municipalities who want materials in Swedish
- When Swedish partners ask for philosophical background

---

### **nature-food-kim-2024.pdf** (Scientific article, ~8 pages)
**"Dietary shifts alone fail without economic transition mechanisms"**

Published in *Nature Food*, this peer-reviewed study validates a core GGF insight:
- You can't solve climate crisis with behavior change alone
- You need structural economic transition mechanisms
- Hearts currency is exactly this kind of mechanism

**When to read:**
- When someone questions "is this just idealism?"
- When writing grant applications that need scientific backing
- When talking to academics or researchers
- When addressing skepticism about economic transition feasibility

**What you'll get:**
- Scientific legitimacy ("Nature published this, not us")
- Evidence that our approach is structurally necessary
- Ammunition against "just change consumer behavior" arguments

**Key quote to use:** "Our findings suggest that dietary change interventions must be coupled with economic system transformation to achieve meaningful climate impact."

### **GGF Vision 2050 - The Pathway to Planetary Stewardship** (Strategic roadmap, ~4 pages, 15 min)
**The 25-year pathway from pilots to planetary stewardship**

Four phases:
- **2026-2028:** The Seed & The Sovereign (Stockholm + Sápmi pilots)
- **2028-2032:** The Mycelial Network (inter-bioregional trade)
- **2032-2045:** The Great Migration (institutional transfer as states fail)
- **2045-2050:** The Open Hand (planetary homeostasis)

**When to read:**
- When the daily grind of grant applications feels meaningless
- When you need to remember WHY we're doing this
- When someone asks "what's the endgame?"
- When you're burnt out and need to reconnect with purpose

**What you'll get:**
- The long view (this isn't just about one pilot)
- How today's boring work connects to tomorrow's transformation
- Inspiration and renewed sense of purpose

**Warning:** This is aspirational, not operational. Don't use this in grant applications (too visionary). Use it for yourself when you need to remember the stakes.

### **spiral-dynamics.md** (Optional framework, ~5 pages, 10 min)
**Björn's diagnostic tool for understanding value systems**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This is completely optional. You don't need to read or use this to do your job well.**

Spiral Dynamics is a developmental framework that maps how individuals and organizations evolve through different value systems (color-coded stages). Björn uses it as a thinking tool to:
- Understand why stakeholders want incompatible things
- Tailor communication to different audiences
- Design systems that integrate multiple values

**CRITICAL WARNING IN THE FILE:**
The file itself contains strong warnings about **NEVER using the color-coded language externally**. If you read it, you must always translate to concrete values when communicating.

**When to read:**
- When you're curious how Björn thinks about systems
- When you hit a wall understanding why groups conflict
- When you want a framework for tailoring communication
- **Only if you're genuinely interested** (not required)

**When NOT to read:**
- When you're busy with execution (stick to 01-WORKING-DOCS)
- When writing grant applications (use concrete language instead)
- If you're not curious (it's fine to ignore this completely)

**What you'll get:**
- A lens for understanding value-based conflicts
- Insight into how GGF architecture integrates different values
- Communication strategy tips (though you can get these from experience)

**Critical rule if you do use it:**
- **Think** in Spiral (colors help you diagnose)
- **Speak** in values (concrete, human language)
- **Never** use colors externally (sounds like categorizing people)

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "This municipality is Blue/Green conflict"
- ✅ Good: "This municipality is torn between rule-following and inclusion"

The file teaches this distinction explicitly. If you read it, follow the warnings.

## How to Use This Folder

**Don't read everything linearly.** These are reference materials. Use them strategically:

### If someone asks: "What's the philosophy behind GGF?"
→ Share **Architecture of the Open Hand** (Part IV at minimum)

### If someone asks: "Is there scientific evidence this approach works?"
→ Share **Nature Food article** + cite the findings

### If someone asks: "Where is this going long-term?"
→ Share **Vision 2050** (but only after they're already engaged)

### If someone asks: "How do you think about different stakeholder values?"
→ **DON'T share spiral-dynamics.txt** (they don't need the framework)
→ Instead, explain in concrete terms: "Different groups optimize for different things - some want efficiency, some want inclusion, some want stability. Our system integrates all three."

### If you're writing a grant application:
→ Pull quotes from **Architecture** (theoretical foundation)
→ Cite **Nature Food** (scientific validation)
→ Avoid **Vision 2050** (too ambitious for funding applications)
→ **Never mention Spiral Dynamics** (sounds like jargon)

### If you're having a bad day:
→ Read **Vision 2050** to remember why this matters
→ Read **Architecture Part VI** (Conclusion) for the emotional core

### If you're curious about Björn's thinking frameworks:
→ Read **spiral-dynamics.txt** (but only if genuinely interested)
→ Follow the warnings in the file religiously
→ Never use it as a communication tool externally

## Optional Deep Dives

**For persuasive writing:**
Read Architecture of the Open Hand, then practice explaining it in 3 sentences:
1. "We're trapped in systems that force destructive choices even when people want peace."
2. "GGF redesigns the architecture so cooperation becomes rational, not suicidal."
3. "We're building working prototypes, not writing manifestos."

**For academic partnerships:**
Skim Nature Food article, note the methodology, be ready to discuss how Hearts currency operationalizes their findings.

**For maintaining motivation:**
Keep Vision 2050 handy. When municipal bureaucracy crushes your soul, remember: you're laying the groundwork for Phase I of a 25-year transformation.

## What's NOT Here (But You Might Want Later)

These documents focus on the "why" and "how" at the conceptual level. For the "what" (concrete proposals), see:
- **03-Portfolio/** for all TAK documents
- **00-START-HERE/** for operational summaries

---

## A Note on Using This Material

**Do:**
- Reference these ideas in grant applications
- Share PDFs with interested partners (except spiral-dynamics.txt)
- Use quotes in persuasive writing
- Cite Nature Food article as scientific backing
- Read spiral-dynamics.txt if curious (but follow its warnings)

**Don't:**
- Lead with philosophy (lead with concrete proposals)
- Expect bureaucrats to read 20-page essays (give them summaries)
- Use Vision 2050 in funding applications (too utopian)
- Get lost in theory when you should be executing
- **Ever mention Spiral Dynamics to external stakeholders** (sounds like jargon/categorizing)
- **Ever use color-coded language in meetings** ("Blue/Green conflict" → "torn between rules and inclusion")

**Remember:** These documents exist to support the work, not replace it. The work is in the `01-WORKING-DOCS/` folder. This is the fuel that keeps you going.

## Questions or Clarifications?

If you need help understanding any of these concepts, or want to discuss how to use them strategically:
- Add a comment in the Projektpromemoria Doc
- Bring it up in Monday sync
- Email Björn directly

The philosophy is important. But execution is everything.

**Build first. Philosophize second.**
