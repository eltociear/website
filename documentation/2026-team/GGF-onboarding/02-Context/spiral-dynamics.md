# Spiral Dynamics - Optional Context

**NOTE: This is background material. NOT required for your work.**

If you've ever wondered "how does Björn think about development, values, and systems," this is one of the frameworks I use:

**https://spiralize.org**

## What It Is

Spiral Dynamics is a developmental model that maps how individuals, organizations, and societies evolve through different value systems (color-coded stages: Beige, Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise, etc.).

I use it as a diagnostic tool to understand:
- Why different stakeholders want incompatible things
- Why certain arguments work with some people but not others
- How to design systems that satisfy multiple value systems simultaneously

## CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**NEVER use the color-coded language when talking to people.**

**BAD (sounds like you're categorizing them):**
- "This municipality is stuck in Blue/Green conflict"
- "That politician is very Orange"
- "We need Yellow thinking to solve this"

**GOOD (translates to actual values):**
- "This municipality is torn between rule-following and inclusion"
- "That politician prioritizes efficiency and measurable results"
- "We need to integrate multiple perspectives systematically"

## Why This Matters

**The danger of Spiral language:**
- Sounds like you're putting people in boxes
- Creates "us vs them" (we're evolved, they're not)
- Makes you sound like a guru or cultist
- Undermines credibility instantly

**People hate being categorized.** They especially hate being told they're at a "lower stage."

Even if you mean it descriptively (not judgmentally), it will be heard as condescending.

## How to Use This Framework (If You Choose To)

**Internally (in your head):**
- "Ah, this stakeholder values stability and clear rules (Blue)"
- "This group optimizes for inclusion and consensus (Green)"
- "We need to design something that satisfies both without compromise (Yellow integration)"

**Externally (when communicating):**
- "This stakeholder needs legal certainty and process clarity"
- "This group needs participatory design and equitable outcomes"
- "Our architecture provides both through [specific mechanism]"

**See the difference?**
- Same insight
- Same strategic thinking
- But one sounds human, the other sounds like jargon

## When This Framework Is Useful

**For you (the VL) it can help with:**

1. **Understanding resistance:**
   - Why do some municipalities love innovation but hate risk?
   - Why do some politicians want both growth AND degrowth?
   - Why do environmental groups sometimes block green energy?

2. **Tailoring communication:**
   - Business community: Frame in efficiency, ROI, competitive advantage
   - Social movements: Frame in equity, inclusion, systems change
   - Administrators: Frame in legal clarity, risk management, reversibility

3. **Diagnosing conflicts:**
   - When two groups want incompatible things, it's often because they're optimizing for different values
   - GGF architecture works because it integrates values instead of forcing compromise

## When to Ignore This Framework

**Don't use Spiral Dynamics if:**
- You're writing a grant application (use concrete language)
- You're pitching to a municipality (talk about their problems, not theory)
- You're in a meeting with stakeholders (translate, don't categorize)
- You're not sure if it's helpful (default to concrete over theoretical)

## Bottom Line

**Spiral Dynamics is a thinking tool, not a communication tool.**

- Think in Spiral (helps you understand)
- Speak in values (helps others understand)
- Never use colors (makes you sound weird)

If you find this framework useful, great. If not, ignore it completely. Your job is to execute, not to become a developmental theorist.

**The system works whether you understand Spiral Dynamics or not.**

## Questions?

If you're curious about how I use this in designing GGF architecture, ask during a sync. But there's no pressure to engage with this at all.

It's in the folder because transparency > mystery. Not because it's required reading.

---

**TL;DR:**
- Spiral Dynamics = diagnostic tool Björn uses
- Helps understand why people want different things
- NEVER use color language externally
- Always translate to concrete values
- Completely optional for your work
