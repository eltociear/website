# Brand Assets

Visual identity for GGF. Use these when creating presentations, documents, or external communications.

## What's Here

### **logo.svg** (Vector format)
**When to use:**
- Presentations (scales infinitely without pixelation)
- Print materials (posters, brochures)
- Web graphics (modern browsers support SVG)
- Any situation where you need to resize the logo

**How to use:**
- Open directly in modern browsers
- Import into design tools (Figma, Illustrator, Canva)
- Embed in HTML/CSS for web

---

### **logo.png** (Raster format)
**When to use:**
- Quick insertions (Word documents, PowerPoint)
- Email signatures
- Situations where SVG isn't supported
- Social media profile pictures

**How to use:**
- Drag and drop into Office documents
- Use as-is for most standard applications

**Note:** PNG is raster (pixels), so it can get blurry if scaled too large. For large prints, use SVG instead.

## Logo Usage Guidelines

### **Where the logo should appear:**

✅ **Front page of all TAK proposals**
✅ **Cover slide of presentations**
✅ **Email signatures** (VL should add this)
✅ **Grant applications** (top of cover page)
✅ **Letterhead** for official communications
✅ **Website** (if/when we build one)

### **Size recommendations:**

- **Documents (Word/PDF):** 100-120px width on cover page
- **Presentations (PowerPoint/Google Slides):** Top left corner, 80-100px
- **Email signature:** 60-80px width
- **Social media profile:** 400x400px minimum (use PNG)

### **Placement:**

**Formal documents (TAK proposals, grant applications):**
- Top center or top left of cover page
- Sufficient white space around it (don't crowd)
- Paired with document title below

**Presentations:**
- Top left corner of title slide
- Optional: Small version in footer of all slides
- NOT on every slide (looks cluttered)

**Emails:**
- Signature block at bottom
- Linked to website when we have one

---

## Color & Styling

The logo works best with:
- **White backgrounds** (clean, professional)
- **Light gray backgrounds** (#f8f9fa or similar)
- **Dark backgrounds** (if you invert colors in design tool)

**Avoid:**
- Busy backgrounds (logo gets lost)
- Stretching or distorting (maintain aspect ratio)
- Tilting or rotating (keep it horizontal)

---

## When You Need Additional Assets

**If you need:**

**Business cards:**
- Use logo.svg + minimal text
- Design in Canva or similar tool
- Run final design by Björn before printing

**Presentation template:**
- Create in Google Slides or PowerPoint
- Use logo in header
- Keep design minimal (content over decoration)
- Save as template for reuse

**Social media graphics:**
- Use Canva or similar
- Include logo + key message
- Keep text minimal (images are for catching attention)

**Letterhead:**
- Logo top left
- Contact info bottom
- Minimal design (professional, not flashy)

---

## Brand Voice & Tone

When creating materials, maintain GGF's voice:

**We are:**
- **Systematic** (not vague or aspirational)
- **Pragmatic** (not utopian)
- **Evidence-based** (cite Nature Food, MSB doctrine)
- **Respectful** (not arrogant or preachy)
- **Honest about uncertainty** (this is experimental)

**We are NOT:**
- Selling a product
- Promising certainty
- Attacking individuals (we critique systems)
- Using fear or guilt (we offer solutions)

**Good examples:**
- "We're testing whether psychological resilience can be built into infrastructure"
- "This proposal addresses the coordination failure between transit and health budgets"
- "The pilot is reversible - if it fails, we document why and learn"

**Bad examples:**
- "This will save Stockholm!" (overpromise)
- "Current systems are broken and corrupt" (accusatory)
- "Join the revolution" (rhetoric over substance)

## Questions or Requests?

**If you need:**

## Quick Start Checklist

If you're creating a document right now:

- [ ] Logo on cover page (logo.svg or logo.png)
- [ ] Fonts: Inter for headings, Crimson Pro for body text
- [ ] White or light gray background
- [ ] Professional tone (systematic, pragmatic, evidence-based)
- [ ] Contact info included (email, website when available)

**When in doubt:** Look at existing TAK proposals for style reference.

Build with precision. Communicate with clarity.
