# Portfolio: TAK Proposals

This folder contains all our concrete municipal proposals. Each TAK document is a ready-to-pitch solution for specific governance challenges.

## What "TAK" Means

**TAK** = Swedish for "ceiling" or "roof"

The naming metaphor: Most municipal systems have bugs (fel) in their "operating system." Each TAK document identifies a specific error code and proposes the fix.

Example: **TAK-404** = "Missing Roof" in the housing system (404 = "not found" in web terminology)

## The Portfolio

### **TAK-405-sammanfattning.pdf** (Stockholm/Uppsala)
**"Regionens Nervsystem" - Psychological resilience in public transit**

**The Problem:**
- Region Stockholm pays twice for the same citizens: first for stress-inducing commutes, then for stress-related healthcare
- MSB's totalförsvar doctrine requires psychological resilience, but systems undermine it daily

**The Solution:**
- 4 concrete pilots in public transit (Vila-vagnen, Återhämtningslinjen, Friskvårdspunkter, 7-minutersregeln)
- Externally funded (MSB + EU) = budget-neutral for region
- Integrates civil defense psychology directly into infrastructure

**Status:** Submitted to Region Stockholm December 2024
**Your task:** Follow up (week 4), prepare adapted pitch for Uppsala

**When to use:**
- Primary pitch for Stockholm/Uppsala
- Example when talking to other regions with public transit
- Proof that GGF can produce concrete, fundable proposals

---

### **TAK-404-housing.pdf** (Upplands Väsby + other suburban municipalities)
**"Bostadscirkeln" - Systemic housing strategy**

**The Problem:**
- The impossible triangle: need for new housing + requirement for profitability + need for affordable rent
- Traditional tools (detaljplan) can't mandate affordability (PBL restrictions)

**The Solution:**
- "Density as currency" - bonus building rights in exchange for Community Land Trust (CLT)
- Civil law workaround for PBL limitations
- "Grannskaps-kontrakt" that reframes social mix as security enhancement, not charity

**Status:** Concept complete, not yet pitched
**Your task:** Identify suitable municipality if Stockholm/Uppsala don't work out

**When to use:**
- Suburban municipalities struggling with housing crisis
- As alternative if TAK-405 doesn't fit a specific municipality
- Example of how GGF thinks systematically about governance failures

---

### **TAK-502-rural.pdf** (National level + landsbygdskommuner)
**"Rätten att Stanna" - National rural resilience strategy**

**The Problem:**
- Rural depopulation creates national security vulnerability
- "Brain drain" from regions that produce food, energy, resources
- Current subsidies are passive, don't address root causes

**The Solution:**
- Tech-neutral connectivity guarantee (satellite/5G, not just fiber)
- Regional tax shifting (lower payroll tax, higher resource extraction tax)
- Voluntary rural service corps (like military service, but for regeneration)

**Status:** Concept complete, national-level proposal
**Your task:** Keep on radar for if we get contact with Näringsdepartementet or similar

**When to use:**
- If we get contact with national government
- If rural municipalities reach out
- Example of GGF thinking at multiple scales (not just urban)

**Note:** This is more ambitious than TAK-404/405. Don't lead with this unless you have specific national-level contact.

---

### **omställningsgaranti.pdf** (Theoretical component)
**"Transition Guarantee" - Economic safety net for system change**

**The Problem:**
- People resist change not because they're stupid, but because they're scared
- "Just transition" rhetoric doesn't actually guarantee workers won't be destroyed

**The Solution:**
- Concrete guarantee: if your job is eliminated by necessary transition (fossil fuels → renewables), you get:
  - Retraining funded
  - Basic income during transition
  - Priority access to Hearts economy jobs
  - Community integration support

**Status:** Theoretical framework, supports Hearts currency
**Your task:** Use as supporting document when explaining Hearts economy

**When to use:**
- Not a standalone pitch
- Include when explaining how Hearts currency prevents social collapse
- Reference when addressing "what about workers?" concerns
- Attach to grant applications that ask about social impact

## How to Use This Portfolio

### **When pitching to municipalities:**

**Start with the problem they already know about:**
- Public transit stress? → TAK-405
- Housing crisis? → TAK-404  
- Rural depopulation? → TAK-502

**Then show the solution is:**
1. Concrete (not theoretical)
2. Externally funded (not their budget)
3. Testable (pilot, not permanent commitment)
4. Evidence-based (cite Nature Food, MSB doctrine, etc.)

### **When someone asks "what else can GGF do?"**

Show them the portfolio:
- "We're not a one-trick pony. Here are 3 different TAK proposals for different challenges."
- "Each addresses a specific governance failure with systemic architecture."
- "Pick the one that fits your municipality's needs."

### **When writing grant applications:**

Attach the relevant TAK as proof that:
- We've done the homework
- We understand municipal realities
- We can translate theory into practice
- We're not just philosophers - we're builders

## Customization & Adaptation

**These TAKs are templates, not rigid scripts.**

### If a municipality says: "Interesting, but we have X constraint..."

**Good response:**
"The core architecture stays the same, but we can adapt implementation to your context. For example, TAK-405 was written for Stockholm's tunnelbana, but we can redesign it for Uppsala's bus system or Göteborg's spårvagnar."

### If a municipality says: "We have Y problem not covered here..."

**Good response:**
"These are our initial TAKs. We're currently working on TAK-XXX for [their specific problem]. Can we schedule a follow-up in 4 weeks to present a customized solution?"

**Then:** Work with Björn to create a new TAK addressing their specific need.

---

## The Pattern Across All TAKs

Notice what they all share:

1. **Diagnosis:** Specific, named governance failure
2. **Root cause:** Not individual malice, but systemic mis-incentivization
3. **Solution:** Architectural redesign that makes cooperation rational
4. **Implementation:** Concrete mechanisms, not vague aspirations
5. **Financing:** External funding when possible
6. **Pilot:** Test first, scale if successful

**This is the GGF method.** Not manifestos. Executable code for governance.

## What's Missing (Opportunities for New TAKs)

Potential future TAKs based on likely municipal needs:

- **TAK-301:** Circular economy implementation (waste → resource)
- **TAK-601:** Democratic innovation (participatory budgeting at scale)
- **TAK-701:** Climate adaptation (bioregional coordination)
- **TAK-801:** AI transition governance (who owns automation gains?)

**If you identify a municipality with a problem we haven't addressed:**
1. Note it in the Municipal Contact Log
2. Discuss in Monday sync
3. We can draft a new TAK if it's strategic

---

## Presentation Tips

**When showing a TAK to municipal officials:**

**DO:**
- Lead with their problem (stress, housing, depopulation)
- Emphasize external funding
- Show concrete mechanisms (not philosophy)
- Offer pilot (low commitment)
- Be ready to adapt to their constraints

**DON'T:**
- Lead with "we're redesigning civilization" (even if true)
- Overwhelm with all TAKs at once (pick the relevant one)
- Get defensive if they critique details (iterate, don't argue)
- Promise certainty (this is experimental - be honest)

**Remember:** Municipal officials are risk-averse but problem-exhausted. Show them the problem is worse than the risk of trying something new.

## Living Portfolio

This portfolio will grow. As we:
- Learn from pilot implementations
- Encounter new municipal challenges
- Develop new mechanisms

We'll create new TAKs and refine existing ones.

**Your feedback matters:** If something in a TAK doesn't work in practice, tell Björn. We update based on reality, not defend based on theory.

## Questions?

If you need:
- Help understanding a specific TAK
- Guidance on which TAK to pitch to which municipality
- Support adapting a TAK to a specific context
- A new TAK created for an emerging opportunity

→ Bring it to Monday sync or comment in Projektpromemoria Doc

**These are tools, not scripture. Use them to build.**
