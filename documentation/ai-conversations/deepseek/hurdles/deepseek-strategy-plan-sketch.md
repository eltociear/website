I recommend a **modular, fractal plan with a strong central core**—a structure that combines the clarity of a grand vision with the adaptability of a loose network.

Here's the specific architecture I would suggest:

## The "Fractal Action Plan"

### Level 1: The Unchanging Core (The "Constitution")
**This is your non-negotiable center** - the equivalent of 2-3 pages that everyone agrees on:
- **Purpose:** "To create systems of Right Relationship where human and planetary flourishing are the primary measures of success"
- **Core Principles:** The 4-5 key ideas from your frameworks (e.g., "We value care work as much as paid work," "Local sovereignty with global cooperation")
- **North Star Metrics:** LMCI, ecological health, equity measures
- **Red Lines:** What you will never compromise (e.g., "No system that requires infinite growth on a finite planet")

**This core is your grand strategy** - but it's brief enough to fit on one page.

### Level 2: Modular Action Kits (The "Toolboxes")
Instead of one giant plan, create **self-contained packages** that different groups can pick up:
- **"BAZ Starter Kit"** - Exactly what you have: the 4-step process for local communities
- **"Treaty Advocacy Kit"** - For diplomats: the 3 keystone reforms + talking points
- **"Hearts Implementation Guide"** - For credit unions and local economies
- **"Community Weaver Training Module"** - For facilitators

Each kit is **complete in itself** but references the core principles.

### Level 3: Emergent Coordination (The "Living Network")
**This is where you embrace looseness:**
- A **lightweight communication protocol** (regular check-ins, shared learning)
- A **"What's Working" database** where groups share successes/failures
- **Open invitations** for new modules to emerge from the edges

## Why This Structure Wins

**It avoids the failures of each approach:**
- **Grand Overarching Plan:** Becomes rigid, can't adapt to local conditions
- **Loose Plan:** Lacks coordination and can dissipate energy
- **No Plan:** Fails to provide direction or build momentum

**Your framework already suggests this structure:**
- The **Treaty** is your Level 1 Core
- The **BAZ Starter Pack** and **AUBI Implementation** are your Level 2 Modules
- The **Community Weavers** and **Social Resilience Council** are your Level 3 Coordination

## The Implementation Rule: "Tight on Why, Loose on How"

**Be absolutely rigid about:**
- The core purpose and principles
- The commitment to Right Relationship
- The rejection of pyramid-style economics

**Be completely flexible about:**
- Which modules communities adopt first
- The specific local implementations
- The timing and sequencing

## Your Immediate Next Step

Create the **one-page "Core Constitution"** that captures the irreducible essence. Then release your first 2-3 modules (BAZ Starter, Treaty Keystones, Hearts Basics) and see which ones gain traction.

The communities that gravitate toward the BAZ kit will become your grassroots proof points. The diplomats who embrace the Treaty reforms will become your institutional allies. They'll be working on different pieces, but aligned toward the same core purpose.

This approach lets you **scale clarity without imposing control** - which is exactly what your framework proposes for governance itself. You're not just building a new system; you're embodying it in your strategy.
