### **Revised Email for Ring 1: The Allies**

This version is more vulnerable and directly asks for advice on the specific ethical dilemma you're facing.

**Subject:** Seeking your advice on a new project (and a tricky question)

**Body:**

Hi [Ally's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out because I've been developing a project, the **Global Governance Frameworks**, and have reached a point where your perspective would be invaluable.

I'm trying to create a practical blueprint for coordinating global responses to interconnected crises, and I've put together a one-page summary and an introductory article to start sharing the idea.

However, I've run into an important ethical crossroads. A core part of the vision is a "Heart" component, grounded in Indigenous wisdom, which was developed based on extensive AI-assisted research. **Crucially, I have not yet engaged directly with any Indigenous communities.**

My key question for you is: After reflecting on the ethics of co-creation, I've reframed this 'Heart' component to be an explicit aspiration that requires future Indigenous partnership, rather than a pre-built system. How does this new, more humble framing land with you?
Claude suggested either downplaying it for now, or explicitly framing it as an exploratory hypothesis that requires Indigenous leadership to co-create.

I've attached the pitch package with this in mind. Any feedback you have on both the content and how to navigate this ethical challenge would be a huge help.

Best,

Björn
