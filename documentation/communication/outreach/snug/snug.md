Hey Snug,

I hope you’re doing well!

I’m reaching out because I’ve been working on a massive project—a "systems architecture" for governance resilience—and I find myself needing a legal brain to sanity-check the logic.

I know we usually connect over gaming, but in my "real life," I’ve been building a framework called the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) (you might remember the trojan horse/political thought experiment I sent you in August, which was related). Essentially, it’s a blueprint for "Civilizational Backup Systems" (alternative economic and truth-verification protocols) designed to kick in when standard democratic institutions fail.

I just finished a white paper analyzing the Weimar Republic’s collapse not as a political event, but as a constitutional/structural failure—and how we are seeing the exact same legal and economic fragility today (2026 horizon).

I’m currently sending this to people like Anders Wijkman (Club of Rome), but I realized I would value the perspective of someone who actually understands the law and structural integrity.

Would you be open to taking a look? It’s about 27 pages, but Section 3 (The Architecture) and Section 5 (Objections) are where the core legal questions live. If you're pressed for time, just the Executive Summary would give me enough feedback.

I’m specifically curious if the legal logic regarding "Parallel Sovereignty" (Bioregional Zones) holds water, or where the obvious failure points would be from a legal perspective.

Let me know if you’re up for a "systems audit"!

Best, Björn
