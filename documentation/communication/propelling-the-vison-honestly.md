For each taking action section, we could reframe like we have done for the cultural-heritage-preservation framework:

"Let's pause and consider how to best frame this section, taking into account the status of the GGF:
* I'm the only one working on the project, and it is not a formal organization yet
* But, we could still enable our full vision and provide help towards that aim
* My hope is that more capable people will establish the formal organization, recognizing the powerful ground work we are doing"
