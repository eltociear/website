### 1. The Personal LinkedIn Post

*This post is designed to bridge the gap between "Björn the Author" and "GGF the Initiative." It frames the organization as the practical application of your theoretical work.*

**Headline:**
From diagnosis to design: Why I founded Global Governance Frameworks.

**Post Body:**
For a long time, my work has focused on the diagnosis—understanding the "Integration Crisis" and why winning the game of civilization often feels like losing.

But diagnosis is only the first step. To move forward, we need a blueprint for what comes next.

Since March, I have been architecting a new open-source initiative: **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)**.

We often talk about the "meta-crisis" as if it were an unsolvable knot. I believe it is actually a design problem. We are trying to run a planetary civilization on outdated operating systems.

GGF is the dedicated home for building the replacement. It is an ecosystem of frameworks built on three pillars:

1. **The Hardware:** Redesigning institutions.
2. **The Heart:** Cultivating human flourishing.
3. **The Nervous System:** Leveraging AI and data for wise decision-making.

I invite you to follow the new page where we will be releasing the specific models and blueprints we are developing.

This is not just about surviving the crisis. It’s about what it would take for humanity to thrive together.
