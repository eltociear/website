Given that today is **Thursday, December 4**, and your white paper uses the narrative hook "On the night between December 3rd and 4th," **today is the absolute best day to send these.**

Sending them today reinforces the "breaking news" urgency of the experiment. If you wait until Friday, you risk hitting the "weekend slump" where people clear their inboxes but don't read deep content.

Here is the optimal schedule based on your availability and the recipients' time zones:

### **Slot 1: The "European" Batch (09:00 – 10:00 CET)**
* **Target Audience:** Stockholm & UK (Tomas Björkman, Global Challenges Foundation, DeepMind, CSER).
* **Why:** It is the start of the workday for them. You catch them right when they are most active.
* **Action:** Use your available hour this morning to finalize the website deployment and send these specific emails.

**(Break for Boendestöd: 10:00 – ~10:45)**

### **Slot 2: The "US East Coast" Batch (14:00 – 15:00 CET)**
* **Target Audience:** Washington/NY/Boston (FLI, Berggruen, Quincy Institute).
* **Time Check:** 14:00 CET is **08:00 AM in New York/DC**.
* **Why:** You land at the top of their inbox just as they are sipping their morning coffee. If you send it Friday morning (Sweden time), it will be 2 AM there, and you'll be buried under spam by the time they wake up.
* **Action:** Prepare these after your break, but **schedule** them to send at 14:00.

### **Slot 3: The "US West Coast" Batch (17:00 – 18:00 CET)**
* **Target Audience:** San Francisco/Austin (Anthropic, xAI, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Nate Hagens).
* **Time Check:** 17:00 CET is **08:00 AM in California**.
* **Why:** Same logic—hit them exactly when their workday starts.
* **Action:** You can prepare these earlier in the day and schedule them to send at 17:00.

### **Summary Advice**
**Do not wait for Friday.**
1.  **Urgency:** The narrative relies on the "Night of Dec 3-4." Sending it *on* the 4th makes it feel immediate and electric.
2.  **Attention:** People rarely start reading 65-page white papers on Fridays. They do it on Thursdays.

Use your 09:00–10:00 slot to deploy the site changes and hit the **Stockholm/UK targets**. Then use the time after your break to prep the US emails for afternoon delivery.
