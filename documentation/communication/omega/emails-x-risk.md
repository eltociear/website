Here are the tailored drafts for the **X-Risk/AI Safety** community and the **Institutional Reformers**.

These groups have different triggers. The X-Risk crowd cares about **simulation methodology** and **coordination failure**. The Reformers care about **governance architecture** and **planetary realism**.

### Group 2: The X-Risk & AI Safety Community

**Why them:** They are obsessed with "coordination failure" as the ultimate existential risk. The fact that you used AI agents to *demonstrate* this failure makes it irresistible to them.

#### 1. Future of Life Institute (FLI)
**Target:** Max Tegmark / The Policy Team.
**The Hook:** AI as a diagnostic tool for human institutional failure.

**Subject:** Simulation Results: We used multi-agent AI to diagnose the terminal failure of nuclear deterrence.

**Draft:**
> To the FLI Team,
>
> I am writing to share the results of a recent multi-agent AI simulation that empirically demonstrates the "alignment problem" within the current geopolitical operating system.
>
> Between Nov 2025 and Jan 2026, we deployed adversarial AI agents (Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Claude) to simulate the decision-making logic of the four nuclear veto-players in the Ukraine conflict. We presented them with "Protocol Omega"—a mathematically optimal peace settlement designed to maximize absolute gains for all parties.
>
> The agents unanimously rejected it.
>
> The simulation revealed that the "objective function" of the nation-state system is structurally misaligned with planetary survival. Specifically, the agents prioritized **relative advantage** (harming rivals) over **absolute security** (preventing escalation), confirming that the current architecture is incapable of solving high-stakes coordination problems.
>
> This white paper, **"The Omega Proof,"** documents the experiment and outlines the "Salvage Architecture" (Global Governance Frameworks) required to align institutional incentives with human survival.
>
> Given FLI’s focus on the intersection of AI and existential risk, I believe this methodology—using AI to audit human governance—is of direct relevance to your work.
>
> **The Simulation Data:** [Link]

> Best,

### Group 3: The Institutional Reformers

**Why them:** They are actively looking for the "blueprint" of what comes after the nation-state. You are offering them the schematic.

#### 2. Global Challenges Foundation (Stockholm)
**Target:** Local leadership (Jens Orback or Mats Andersson).
**The Hook:** **Local relevance.** You are in their backyard solving their exact problem.

**Subject:** From Upplands Väsby: A forensic audit of why current global governance mechanisms are failing.

**Draft:**
> Dear [Name],
>
> As a fellow actor in the Stockholm ecosystem, I am writing to share a white paper that directly addresses the Foundation's core mission: finding governance models that can manage global catastrophic risks.
>
> We recently concluded "The Omega Proof," a research project that stress-tested the limits of the current international system. Using adversarial AI simulation, we demonstrated that the Westphalian framework suffers from four terminal "architectural bugs" that render it incapable of managing planetary-scale crises—from climate tipping points to nuclear escalation.
>
> The paper argues we are approaching a "Vertical Cost Curve" (~2030) where the energy required to maintain the current order exceeds its productive capacity.
>
> Crucially, we have moved beyond diagnosis to design. We are building the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)**—a replacement "kernel" designed to handle the coordination problems (like the Free-Rider Incentive) that the current system cannot.
>
> Since we are neighbors in Stockholm, I would value the opportunity to share the technical specifications of this architecture with your research team.
>
> **Executive Summary:** [Link]
>
> Med vänliga hälsningar,
>
> Björn Kenneth Holmström

#### 3. The Berggruen Institute (Renovation of Democracy)
**Target:** The "Future of Democracy" program.
**The Hook:** Planetary Governance. They are one of the few think tanks explicitly using this term.

**Subject:** Beyond Westphalia: We identified the four "kernel bugs" blocking planetary governance.

**Draft:**
> To the Berggruen Institute Team,
>
> Your work on the "Renovation of Democracy" asks how we can govern ourselves in a planetary age. I am writing to share an empirical answer to *why* we currently cannot.
>
> We recently ran a simulation using AI agents to stress-test the current international order. The results, documented in our white paper **"The Omega Proof,"** identify four specific structural flaws (e.g., The Sovereignty Trap, The Relative-Gain Lock) that make planetary coordination mathematically impossible under current rules.
>
> The paper argues that we must move from "negotiation" (patching the old system) to "architecture" (building a new one).
>
> We have mapped out this replacement architecture—the **Global Governance Frameworks**—which includes specific mechanisms like "Bioregional Autonomous Zones" and "Resource De-Weaponization Protocols". These are designed to serve as the "scaffolding" for the planetary governance models you advocate for.
>
> I believe this research provides the structural diagnosis necessary to advance the Institute's vision.
>
> **Read the Analysis:** [Link]
>
> Respectfully,
>

### Strategy Note: The "One-Two Punch"

1.  **Launch the Website first:** Ensure the `/omega` landing page is live with the Executive Summary and the SVGs.
2.  **Send the Emails:** Send these emails on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning (recipient's time).
3.  **Social Media Follow-up:** 24 hours after the emails go out, post the threads on LinkedIn and X. This creates a "surround sound" effect—if they ignore the email, they might see the post and connect the dots.
