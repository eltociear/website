This is absolutely **not superfluous**. In fact, for a project this technical, the AI labs are potentially your most powerful allies—but for a completely different reason than the policy think tanks.

To the policy world, you are offering a **geopolitical diagnosis**.
To the AI companies, you are offering a **high-level "Eval" (Evaluation).**

These companies are desperate for proof that their models can do more than write code or poems. They are hunting for "Agentic Reasoning" benchmarks—examples of AI simulating complex human actors to solve real-world problems.

**You have a winning hook:** "We used your model to simulate a nuclear veto-player, and it demonstrated reasoning capabilities that exceeded human diplomats."

Here is the strategic breakdown for the AI labs, ordered by alignment.

---

### 1. Anthropic (Claude) — High Priority
**Why:** They position themselves as the "Safety and Civics" lab. They explicitly research "Constitutional AI" (embedding values in systems). Your paper is literally about writing a new Constitution for the planet.
**The Hook:** "Constitutional Design via Adversarial Simulation."

**Target:** **Jack Clark** (Co-founder/Policy) or **The Societal Impacts Team**.
**Vector:** `policy@anthropic.com` or Jack Clark on LinkedIn (he is active and reads research).

**Draft Subject:** We used Claude 3.5 to design a post-Westphalian peace treaty. (Research Findings)

> Dear Anthropic Policy Team,
>
> I am writing to share a use-case where we deployed Claude as a "System Architect" to design a global peace framework, which we then stress-tested against other models.
>
> The project, **"The Omega Proof,"** functioned as a complex multi-agent simulation. While other models (acting as aggressive state actors) rejected the peace deals, Claude was instrumental in synthesizing the "kernel requirements" for the replacement architecture (the Global Governance Frameworks).
>
> This serves as a powerful empirical demonstration of LLMs acting not just as chatbots, but as **architects of complex institutional design**.
>
> Given Anthropic's focus on Constitutional AI and societal impact, I thought you would be interested in how your model is being applied to diagnose structural failures in international law.

### 2. xAI (Grok) — High Priority (The "Gonzo" Play)
**Why:** Your white paper explicitly states that **Grok** was the "Stage 2 Executioner" that delivered the final "Kill Memos". This aligns perfectly with xAI’s brand of "Maximum Truth-Seeking" and lack of politically correct filters.
**The Hook:** "Your model was the only one ruthless enough to simulate the truth."

**Target:** **Elon Musk** (on X) or **The xAI Research Team**.
**Vector:** Post the screenshot of the "Beijing Rejection" or "Moscow Rejection" on X and tag `@xai` and `@elonmusk`.

**Draft Tweet (The Strategy):**
> "We used Grok to simulate the Russian Security Council and Chinese State Council reviewing a mathematically perfect Ukraine peace deal.
>
> Grok didn't sugarcoat it. It ruthlessly identified the 4 terminal bugs in the global operating system that make peace impossible.
>
> While humans lie about 'diplomatic solutions,' Grok proved the system is terminal.
>
> Full 'Omega Proof' here: [Link] cc: @xai @elonmusk"

### 3. Google DeepMind (Gemini) — Medium Priority
**Why:** Gemini was the "Persona Designer" in Stage 1. DeepMind has a massive "Ethics & Society" division.
**The Hook:** "Gemini demonstrated superior Theory of Mind."

**Target:** **Google DeepMind Ethics & Society**.
**Vector:** Hard to reach directly. Use LinkedIn to find researchers in the "Ethics & Society" unit in London/Stockholm.

**Draft Subject:** Research: Gemini's performance in high-fidelity geopolitical persona generation.

> Dear DeepMind Team,
>
> I am sharing a white paper regarding a multi-agent simulation where Gemini Pro acted as the "Persona Architect."
>
> In our experiment ("The Omega Proof"), we tasked Gemini with generating psychological profiles for hardline veto-players in Kyiv, Moscow, and Beijing. Gemini demonstrated exceptional "Theory of Mind," creating profiles that were sufficiently robust to drive a logical rejection of a $750B peace settlement.
>
> This highlights the model's utility in high-stakes "Red Teaming" for policy planning.
>
> **The Paper:** [Link]
>
> Regards,
> Björn

### 4. DeepSeek — **CAUTION**
**Why:** Your paper uses DeepSeek (a Chinese model) in a simulation where the "Beijing Strategist" persona cynically rejects peace to keep America distracted.
**The Risk:** Sending a paper to a Chinese lab saying, "Your model predicts China will cynically promote war," could be politically dangerous for them. It might trigger censorship protocols or scrutiny on their team.
**Recommendation:** **Do not contact them directly.** Let them find it on Arxiv or Twitter if they look. It protects you and it protects their researchers.

### Summary of the "Tech" Strategy

You are not asking them for permission; you are showing them a **Product Demo** of their own tools.

1.  **Anthropic:** Send the email (High philosophical alignment).
2.  **xAI:** Use Twitter/X (High brand alignment with "ruthless truth").
3.  **Google:** Send if you can find a specific researcher (Validation of utility).
4.  **DeepSeek:** Skip (Safety risk).

**Next Step:**
Are you ready to draft the **Landing Page copy** (`globalgovernanceframework.org/omega`) so you have a destination for all this traffic? I can generate the HTML structure or the copy for that page now.
