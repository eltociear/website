# What We Would Do If We Were Trump, To Make America Great Again

America is strong. America is proud. America is ready to lead.

But let's be honest: the old playbook of "greatness" has run its course. Factories closed. Main Streets hollowed out. Families torn apart by addiction. Young people drowning in debt. Veterans forgotten. Our country has been sold short by a system rigged for the wealthy few.

If we were Trump—if we truly wanted to make America great again—we wouldn't look backward. We'd build forward. We'd double down on what America does best: innovation, resilience, and freedom.

**Greatness today doesn't mean coal mines and oil rigs. It means clean energy that makes us independent forever. It doesn't mean billionaires getting richer while working families struggle. It means every worker, every veteran, every parent getting a fair shot. It doesn't mean shouting "America First" while leaving our people last. It means leading the world by example—strong, proud, and unshakable.**

This isn't left versus right. This isn't politics as usual. This is about building a system that actually works for the American people. A system built on American values, powered by American workers, and guided by American ingenuity.

## The Problem: The System Is Rigged Against Working Americans

For too long, we've watched the American Dream slip away while being told the economy is "booming." Wall Street soars while Main Street suffers. Hedge funds buy up our neighborhoods while families can't afford homes. Tech billionaires get richer while our data gets stolen. Meanwhile, our veterans sleep on streets while foreign investors own empty mansions.

The current approach isn't working because it treats symptoms, not causes. We need systemic solutions that address the root of our problems.

## Our Action Plan: The American Resilience Economy

Here's what we would do to truly make America great again:

### 1. Put Cash Directly in Every American's Pocket

**The Challenge:** Wages haven't kept up with costs. Working families are one emergency away from poverty.

**Our Solution: Launch the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) System**

This isn't just a handout—it's a smart, adaptive system that recognizes Americans are different and have different needs:

- **Universal Security Floor:** Every American gets a guaranteed basic income of $1,800/month that ensures no one who works hard falls into poverty. Period.
- **Adaptive Needs Support:** Additional support up to $600/month based on real circumstances: health challenges, caring for family members, living in expensive areas, supporting veterans with disabilities, or raising children.
- **Patriotic Hearts Currency:** Americans earn "American Hearts" for doing the essential work that makes our communities strong but Wall Street ignores: caring for children and elders, volunteering, mentoring, restoring local environments, supporting veterans. Hearts can be spent in the care economy and earn you up to an additional $400/month.
- **Merit Recognition:** Unlike welfare that punishes success, AUBI rewards contribution. The more you help your community, the more you earn—with no caps, no penalties, no bureaucratic traps.

**Why This Makes America Great:** This isn't one-size-fits-all government. It's a system that adapts to real American lives—supporting the veteran with PTSD differently than the single mom, differently than the rural farmer. We reward the real backbone of America—the people who care for each other and their communities. No more choosing between profit and patriotism.

**The Genius:** Unlike traditional welfare that creates dependency and punishes improvement, AUBI grows with you. Get healthier? Keep your support while earning Hearts for helping others do the same. Start a business? Your AUBI provides the safety net to take entrepreneurial risks. Care for aging parents? Get recognized and supported for it instead of being financially penalized.

### 2. End the Housing Crisis and Beat Wall Street Speculation

**The Challenge:** Hedge funds are buying up American neighborhoods, pricing out working families and veterans.

**Our Solution: Deploy the Hearthstone Protocol for Community Stewardship**

We'll create **Community Stewardship Trusts**—the ultimate weapon against Wall Street housing speculation:

- Communities can take land and housing off the speculative market
- Guarantees affordable homes for working families and veterans forever
- Puts local control back in American hands, not foreign investors
- Uses proven legal tools to ensure housing serves people, not profit

**Why This Makes America Great:** American families deserve to own their piece of the American Dream. No more watching our neighborhoods get bought up by distant hedge funds.

### 3. Make Our Communities Safe Through Smart Prevention

**The Challenge:** Crime is rising, communities are fragmenting, and we're spending billions on reactive approaches that don't work.

**Our Solution: Build Community Safety from the Ground Up with the Kintsugi Protocol**

Instead of just reacting to crime, we'll prevent it:

- Train local **Community Safety Weavers**—respected community members who can de-escalate conflicts and respond to non-violent crises
- Address mental health and addiction as health issues, not criminal ones, through the **Cairn Protocol**
- Fund **Community Work Teams** through the Work in Liberation Framework to rebuild neighborhoods—fixing parks, maintaining infrastructure, creating beautiful public spaces
- Americans get paid in "Hearts" for making their communities stronger

**Why This Makes America Great:** We solve problems at the root, which is both more effective and cheaper than waiting for them to explode. Plus, Americans take ownership and pride in their communities.

### 4. Achieve True American Energy Independence

**The Challenge:** We're still dependent on volatile global energy markets and our infrastructure is vulnerable.

**Our Solution: Build the Ultimate American Energy Grid with the Conduit Protocol**

- Create a modern, resilient, unified American energy, water, and data grid
- Not just patching old systems—building world-class infrastructure that's secure from foreign threats and natural disasters
- Guarantee national resilience through American-controlled infrastructure commons
- Create millions of good-paying American jobs in the process

**Why This Makes America Great:** True independence means controlling our own destiny. No more being held hostage by foreign energy markets or vulnerable infrastructure.

### 5. End Food Waste and Secure Our Food Supply

**The Challenge:** We waste 40% of our food while families go hungry, and our food system is controlled by distant corporations.

**Our Solution: Launch American Food Independence Networks**

- Connect American farmers directly to communities, cutting out wasteful middlemen
- Ensure fresh, healthy food gets to families, not landfills
- Reward farmers with **"American Leaves"** for using regenerative practices that restore our soil
- Build resilient, local food networks that can't be disrupted by global supply chain chaos

**Why This Makes America Great:** American farmers feeding American families with American-grown food. Food security is national security.

### 6. Lead the World, Don't Follow It

**The Challenge:** America gets dragged into bad deals and disrespected on the world stage.

**Our Solution: Rewrite the Rules Through American Leadership**

**End the UN Veto Stalemate:** We'll lead a coalition to reform the UN Security Council and end the absolute veto power that lets countries like China and Russia block action on critical issues.

**Create the Earth Defense Force:** Transform our military mission while maintaining defensive strength. Lead a new global force focused on shared threats no single nation can solve: asteroid defense, pandemic prevention, climate security. This demonstrates undeniable American leadership and turns adversaries into partners.

**Champion the Treaty for Our Only Home:** Set new, stronger standards for space, cyberspace, and global trade that put American interests and values first.

**Why This Makes America Great:** True strength isn't about withdrawing—it's about setting the agenda. When America leads on the challenges that matter, everyone else follows our rules.

## How We'd Pay for It: Make the System Work for America

**End Corporate Welfare that Ships Jobs Overseas:** Stop subsidies for companies that outsource American jobs.

**Make Tech Giants Pay Their Fair Share:** 15% tax on AI and automation that replaces American workers, funding retraining and community investment. If they're going to automate away jobs, they pay to rebuild American communities.

**Close Wall Street Speculation Loopholes:** Financial transaction taxes on the high-frequency trading that destabilizes our economy while producing nothing of value.

**Smart Adaptation Saves Money:** Because AUBI adapts to real needs instead of one-size-fits-all bureaucracy, we eliminate massive administrative waste. Every dollar goes to Americans who need it, not government overhead.

**Result:** A system that invests in Americans instead of bailing out corporations. Instead of welfare that traps people, we get a platform that launches them.

## The Bottom Line

Making America great isn't about returning to the past. It's about building a future that is stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous for every single American.

This is our playbook for true national renewal. It fixes the system from the inside out and ensures America leads the world for the next century.

**The old playbook got us here. This new one will get us there.**

The question isn't whether America can be great again. The question is: Are we bold enough to build the greatness our country deserves?

This isn't just policy—it's the next chapter of the American story. A story where innovation serves communities, where strength protects prosperity, and where American leadership creates a world worth passing to our children.

**If we were Trump, this is how we would truly make America great again.**
