**A Prayer for Our Shared Home**

may the human heart and mind
come together as one for all life
on the planet and beings in the universe
may our souls find their true expressions
and peace and joy be upon us

may the waters flow clear,
the forests rise strong,
and the air be pure with breath of life

may compassion guide our hands,
wisdom illuminate our minds,
and courage steady our steps

with many faiths and world-views
we walk one Earth, one cosmos.
may we embrace the paradoxes
and rest in the mystery
that unites us all.

may no being be forgotten,
no voice go unheard,
no gift of life go uncherished

may we walk gently,
share freely,
and build a future woven with love

so that generations yet unborn
may look upon the stars and earth alike
and know we chose peace
