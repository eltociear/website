# **Our Way of Working (A Guide to Our Operating System)**

This document describes our unique culture and how we value contributions. Our culture is a direct application of the principles we advocate in our frameworks.

## **❤️ Value and Compensation: A `Hearts`-Based System**

We are a `Hearts`-based organization, which is a system built on trust, autonomy, and a commitment to valuing care work and other meaningful contributions.

* **Our unit of account is `Heart`:** A `Heart` is a measure of a recognized contribution to our shared mission. It can be anything from research and writing to giving feedback, supporting a colleague, or other work that moves us forward.
* **The mechanism is `Love Ledger`:** Each member is responsible for logging their contributions in our internal **Love Ledger**. This is an expression of our principle of **radical autonomy**.
* **Transparency is our security:** All logged contributions are visible to all other members. This mutual visibility, in a culture of high trust, replaces hierarchical control and ensures fairness.
* **The bridge to today's economy:** The association has a budget in regular currency (SEK/EUR) from grants and contributions. Each month, the available budget is divided by the total number of `Hearts` logged by all members. This creates a temporary exchange rate that enables members to invoice the association for their contributions.
* **Completely voluntary:** The system is voluntary and without coercion. You contribute as much or as little as you want and can. The `Hearts` system is a tool for fair distribution, not an obligation.

## **🧠 Autonomy and Coordination**

Our organization is a network built on high trust and great freedom.

* **Freedom to contribute:** You have complete freedom over your working hours, your workplace, and your equipment. We measure contributions in results and progress, not in hours worked.
* **Coordination through documentation:** In exchange for this freedom, our most important habit is making our work and our thoughts visible through careful documentation. Our shared digital workspace is our collective brain.
* **Meetings are a resource, not a requirement:** All meetings are optional. They are used only when we need to co-create or make decisions that are difficult to handle asynchronously.
* **The right to disconnect:** We trust you to manage your own energy and well-being. Disconnecting from work is not just a right, but a responsibility to be able to contribute sustainably over time.
