# Start Here

**Welcome to Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)!**

If you're reading this, you're about to join a project that's building the infrastructure for a fundamentally different way of organizing human society. Not through revolution, but through parallel construction.

## Your First Day - Read These in Order:

### 1. **GGF-executive-summary.pdf** (5 minutes)
Quick overview of the entire project:
- What problem we're solving (coordination failure at civilizational scale)
- How we're solving it (Hearts currency, BAZs, Treaty of the Circle)
- Why now (2026-2030 is the critical window)
- What success looks like (functional alternatives before polycrisis intensifies)

**Action:** Read this first to understand the big picture.

### 2. **TAK-405-sammanfattning.pdf** (10 minutes)
Our lead pilot project for Stockholm Region:
- "Regionens Nervsystem" - psychological resilience in public transit
- Externally funded (MSB + EU) = budget-neutral for region
- Concrete, testable, low-risk
- Already submitted December 2024

**Action:** Read this to understand what we're actually DOING in Q1 2026.

---

### 3. **Projektpromemoria-Verksamhetsledare** (Google Doc - 30 minutes)
Your operational manual - **this is a LIVING DOCUMENT**:
- Your role and mandate
- What's done, what's missing
- 90-day action plan (Q1 2026)
- Resources you have access to
- Decision rights (what you can decide vs. what requires discussion)
- Success criteria

**Action:** Read thoroughly, add comments on anything unclear, fill in [TBC] sections as you learn more.

---

## After Reading These:

You'll understand:
- ✓ What GGF is and why it exists
- ✓ What you need to do in the first 90 days
- ✓ How we work together (your role + Björn's role)
- ✓ What resources you have access to

## Next Steps:

1. **Import the working documents** (see folder `01-WORKING-DOCS/`)
2. **Skim the context materials** if you want deeper understanding (folder `02-Context/`)
3. **Browse the portfolio** to see all our TAK proposals (folder `03-Portfolio/`)
4. **Schedule your onboarding call** with Björn (60 min to answer questions)

## Optional: For When You Need Inspiration

When the daily work of grant applications and municipal bureaucracy feels tedious, read:

**Vision-2050.pdf** - The 25-year strategic roadmap
- Where we're going (not just where we are)
- How the pieces fit together over decades
- Why this matters beyond any single pilot

This is your "north star" - the reminder that boring spreadsheets today build the architecture of peace tomorrow.

## Questions?

Add them as comments in the Projektpromemoria Google Doc, or bring them to your onboarding call.

The work is unglamorous. The stakes are civilizational. Let's build.
