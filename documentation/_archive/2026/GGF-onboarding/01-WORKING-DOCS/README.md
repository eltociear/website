# Working Documents

These are your daily operational tools. They're **Google Sheets** that you'll update regularly to track progress, manage relationships, and monitor funding opportunities.

## What's Here

All three trackers are already set up as Google Sheets in this folder. Just open them and start using them - no import needed.

**The sheets are pre-formatted with:**
- Frozen header rows (headers stay visible when scrolling)
- Filter dropdowns on all columns
- Color-coded status indicators
- Formula protection where needed

Your job is just to **update the data**, not set up the structure.

## The Three Core Trackers

### 1. **Q1 Action Tracker**
**Google Sheet:** Open "GGF - Q1 2026 Action Tracker"

**What it tracks:**
- All tasks for January-March 2026, broken down by week
- Who's responsible (VL vs Björn)
- Status (❌ Not started / 🔄 In progress / ✅ Done)
- Priorities (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low)
- Milestones and deadlines

**How to use:**
- **Update before every Monday sync** (mark tasks complete, add notes)
- **Review together** during Monday meeting
- **Add new tasks** as they emerge during the week
- **Check blockers section** - flag anything preventing progress

**Pro tip:** Freeze the header row (View → Freeze → 1 row) so you can scroll while keeping column names visible.

### 2. **Funding Opportunities Tracker**
**Google Sheet:** Open "GGF - Funding Opportunities"

**What it tracks:**
- All potential funding sources (MSB, Vinnova, EU Horizon, foundations)
- Deadlines and amounts
- How well each fits GGF (🟢 Perfect / 🟡 Good / 🟠 Weak)
- Application status and completion %
- Strategic notes and contact persons

**How to use:**
- **Check deadlines weekly** - don't miss application windows
- **Update % complete** as you draft applications
- **Add new opportunities** as you discover them
- **Read the strategic notes** at bottom - they guide prioritization

**Focus for Q1:**
- MSB Psykologiskt försvar (Deadline: 2026-03-15) - Highest priority
- Vinnova Challenge-driven (Deadline: 2026-02-28)
- EU Horizon Wellbeing (Deadline: 2026-04-30)

### 3. **Municipal Contact Log**
**Google Sheet:** Open "GGF - Municipal Contacts"

**What it tracks:**
- All municipality contacts (name, role, email, phone)
- Contact history (when first contacted, last contact)
- Relationship status (📧 Contacted / 🤝 Active conversation / ✅ LOI signed)
- Interest level (🔥 High / 🟢 Positive / 🟡 Curious / ❄️ Cold)
- Which TAK-proposal fits them
- Next steps and deadlines

**How to use:**
- **Before contacting anyone:** Check if we've talked to them before
- **After every interaction:** Log the contact, update status, set next step
- **Use the templates** at bottom for first outreach emails
- **Watch for red/green flags** - they tell you when to pause or accelerate

**Focus for Q1:**
- Stockholm (follow up on TAK-405 submission)
- Uppsala (new pitch, adapted TAK-405)
- [Third municipality TBD based on network]

## Weekly Workflow

**Monday Morning (before 10:00 sync):**
1. Open all three sheets
2. Update Q1 Action Tracker (mark completed tasks ✅)
3. Check Funding Tracker for approaching deadlines
4. Review Municipal Contact Log (who needs follow-up?)
5. Add any blockers or new tasks discovered last week

**Monday Sync (10:00, 30 min with Björn):**
- Review all three sheets together
- Make decisions on yellow/red items
- Update priorities if needed
- Plan the week ahead

**During the Week:**
- Add new contacts to Municipal Log immediately
- Update Funding Tracker when working on applications
- Check Q1 Tracker daily to stay on schedule

## Link These to Your Calendar

When you set deadlines in these sheets, **add them to your Google Calendar** so you get reminders.

Critical deadlines Q1:
- 2026-01-31: Juridisk struktur klar
- 2026-02-28: Minst 2 bidragsansökningar inskickade
- 2026-03-15: MSB-ansökan deadline
- 2026-03-31: Minst 1 Letter of Intent säkrad

## These Are Living Documents

Don't be afraid to:
- Add rows as new tasks/contacts/opportunities emerge
- Modify columns if you need to track something else
- Reorganize if it helps you work better
- Archive completed tasks to a separate tab

The structure is a starting point. Adapt it to how you actually work.

**The goal:** These sheets should make your work EASIER, not harder. If something isn't working, change it.

## Questions?

If anything is unclear or you need help with Google Sheets functionality, ask during Monday sync or add a comment in the Projektpromemoria Doc.

**Remember:** The work is in the sheets. The vision is in the documents. Both matter.
