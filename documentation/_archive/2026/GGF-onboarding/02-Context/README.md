# Context & Background

This folder contains the theoretical and philosophical foundations of GGF. You don't need to read all of this immediately - it's reference material for when you need deeper understanding.

## What's Here

### **architecture-of-the-open-hand.pdf** (English, 20 pages, ~45 min)
**Why we fight and how we design peace**

The philosophical core of GGF in 6 parts:
- **Part I:** The innocent question (why is there war?)
- **Part II:** The diagnosis (the epistemic error of separation)
- **Part III:** The trap (when good intentions meet bad incentives)
- **Part IV:** The solution (trans-rational architecture) ← **Read this part if you read nothing else**
- **Part V:** The transition pathway (from here to there)
- **Part VI:** Conclusion (the new answer to the child)

**When to read:**
- When someone asks "but WHY does GGF exist?"
- When you need to understand the meta-framework
- When grant applications ask for "theoretical foundation"
- When you're writing persuasive text and need the right words

**What you'll get:**
- Understanding of why GGF isn't just another NGO
- The logic behind Hearts, BAZs, and the Treaty
- How to explain this to skeptics without sounding utopian

**Focus on:** Part IV "The Solution" - it's the most concrete and useful for operational work.

### **architecture-of-the-open-hand-svenska.pdf** (Swedish, 20 pages, ~45 min)
Same content as above, in Swedish.

**When to use:**
- When writing Swedish grant applications
- When pitching to Swedish municipalities who want materials in Swedish
- When Swedish partners ask for philosophical background

---

### **nature-food-kim-2024.pdf** (Scientific article, ~8 pages)
**"Dietary shifts alone fail without economic transition mechanisms"**

Published in *Nature Food*, this peer-reviewed study validates a core GGF insight:
- You can't solve climate crisis with behavior change alone
- You need structural economic transition mechanisms
- Hearts currency is exactly this kind of mechanism

**When to read:**
- When someone questions "is this just idealism?"
- When writing grant applications that need scientific backing
- When talking to academics or researchers
- When addressing skepticism about economic transition feasibility

**What you'll get:**
- Scientific legitimacy ("Nature published this, not us")
- Evidence that our approach is structurally necessary
- Ammunition against "just change consumer behavior" arguments

**Key quote to use:** "Our findings suggest that dietary change interventions must be coupled with economic system transformation to achieve meaningful climate impact."

### **g20-global-inequality-report-2025.pdf** (Policy report, ~70 pages, 2-3 hours)
**"G20 Extraordinary Committee Report on Global Inequality"**

Commissioned by the G20 South Africa Presidency (November 2025), this authoritative report provides comprehensive analysis of global inequality - its scale, drivers, consequences, and policy solutions.

**Why this matters for GGF:**
- The G20 (world's major economies) officially recognizes inequality as an urgent crisis
- Many of the report's policy recommendations align directly with GGF's approach
- It validates that systemic change is necessary, not just redistribution
- Provides hard data and authoritative framing you can use in grant applications

**Key findings that validate GGF:**
- 83% of countries have high income inequality (Gini >0.4)
- Wealth inequality is far higher than income inequality
- Inequality is a *choice* - it results from policy decisions and can be reversed
- Neoliberal policies (deregulation, privatization, austerity) directly increased inequality
- Solutions require rewriting rules, not just redistribution

**When to read:**
- When writing grant applications that need authoritative statistics
- When someone asks "is there evidence this is a real problem?"
- When pitching to municipalities who want to see this is globally recognized
- When you need ammunition against "markets will solve this" arguments

**What you'll get:**
- Devastating statistics on inequality (70+ pages of hard data)
- Analysis of how neoliberal policies created inequality (validates GGF's diagnosis)
- Policy recommendations that overlap with GGF (IP reform, trade rules, public investment)
- Credibility by association (G20-commissioned, major economists including Stiglitz)

**How to use strategically:**

**DO:**
- Extract key statistics for grant applications (summary pages 4-13)
- Reference it as validation: "As the recent G20 inequality report confirms..."
- Use it to show this isn't fringe thinking - it's mainstream concern
- Quote specific statistics (83% of countries have high inequality, etc.)
- Cite it when explaining why Hearts currency and BAZs address real problems

**DON'T:**
- Share the whole 70-page PDF with municipalities (too dense)
- Lead with this in pitches (lead with concrete proposals like TAK-405)
- Use it as a substitute for GGF's own materials
- Forget it's from November 2025 (very recent, very relevant)

**Key sections by use case:**

For **grant applications:**
- Summary Report (pages 4-13): Digestible overview with key stats
- Section 1 (pages 15-21): Hard data on scale of inequality
- Box "Key facts on inequality" (page 5): Perfect for copy-pasting

For **understanding drivers:**
- Section 3 (pages 27-32): Why inequality happened (validates GGF's analysis)
- Subsection on neoliberalism (page 29): Shows policy choices created this

For **policy alignment:**
- Section 5 (pages 34-45): Policy recommendations
- Note how many overlap with GGF: IP reform, rewriting trade rules, public investment, addressing corporate power

For **pitching to academics/researchers:**
- The entire report - shows GGF addresses problems major economists recognize

**Example usage in grant application:**

"According to the November 2025 G20 Global Inequality Report, 83% of countries now experience high income inequality (Gini coefficient >0.4), affecting 90% of the world's population. The report identifies neoliberal policies - deregulation, privatization, and austerity - as key drivers of this inequality, and recommends systemic reforms including rewriting intellectual property rules, reforming trade agreements, and expanding public investment. Our project directly addresses these systemic issues through [specific GGF mechanism]..."

**Critical distinction:**

This report is **external validation**, not GGF material. It strengthens your case by showing that:
- Major international bodies (G20) recognize the same problems
- Leading economists (Stiglitz et al.) validate the diagnosis
- The solutions proposed overlap with GGF's approach

Use it to demonstrate GGF is responding to real, urgent, globally-recognized crises - not pursuing utopian fantasies.

### **GGF Vision 2050 - The Pathway to Planetary Stewardship** (Strategic roadmap, ~4 pages, 15 min)
**The 25-year pathway from pilots to planetary stewardship**

Four phases:
- **2026-2028:** The Seed & The Sovereign (Stockholm + Sápmi pilots)
- **2028-2032:** The Mycelial Network (inter-bioregional trade)
- **2032-2045:** The Great Migration (institutional transfer as states fail)
- **2045-2050:** The Open Hand (planetary homeostasis)

**When to read:**
- When the daily grind of grant applications feels meaningless
- When you need to remember WHY we're doing this
- When someone asks "what's the endgame?"
- When you're burnt out and need to reconnect with purpose

**What you'll get:**
- The long view (this isn't just about one pilot)
- How today's boring work connects to tomorrow's transformation
- Inspiration and renewed sense of purpose

**Warning:** This is aspirational, not operational. Don't use this in grant applications (too visionary). Use it for yourself when you need to remember the stakes.

### **spiral-dynamics.md** (Optional framework, ~5 pages, 10 min)
**Björn's diagnostic tool for understanding value systems**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This is completely optional. You don't need to read or use this to do your job well.**

Spiral Dynamics is a developmental framework that maps how individuals and organizations evolve through different value systems (color-coded stages). Björn uses it as a thinking tool to:
- Understand why stakeholders want incompatible things
- Tailor communication to different audiences
- Design systems that integrate multiple values

**CRITICAL WARNING IN THE FILE:**
The file itself contains strong warnings about **NEVER using the color-coded language externally**. If you read it, you must always translate to concrete values when communicating.

**When to read:**
- When you're curious how Björn thinks about systems
- When you hit a wall understanding why groups conflict
- When you want a framework for tailoring communication
- **Only if you're genuinely interested** (not required)

**When NOT to read:**
- When you're busy with execution (stick to 01-WORKING-DOCS)
- When writing grant applications (use concrete language instead)
- If you're not curious (it's fine to ignore this completely)

**What you'll get:**
- A lens for understanding value-based conflicts
- Insight into how GGF architecture integrates different values
- Communication strategy tips (though you can get these from experience)

**Critical rule if you do use it:**
- **Think** in Spiral (colors help you diagnose)
- **Speak** in values (concrete, human language)
- **Never** use colors externally (sounds like categorizing people)

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "This municipality is Blue/Green conflict"
- ✅ Good: "This municipality is torn between rule-following and inclusion"

The file teaches this distinction explicitly. If you read it, follow the warnings.

### If you're writing a grant application:
→ Pull quotes from **Architecture** (theoretical foundation)
→ Cite **Nature Food** (scientific validation)
→ Extract statistics from **G20 report** (authoritative data - "83% of countries have high inequality affecting 90% of world population")
→ Reference **G20 policy recommendations** that align with your approach
→ Avoid **Vision 2050** (too ambitious for funding applications)
→ **Never mention Spiral Dynamics** (sounds like jargon)

### If you're pitching to municipalities:
→ Lead with **TAK proposals** (concrete, actionable)
→ Use **G20 report** for validation: "Even the G20 recognizes this is urgent..."
→ Keep **Architecture** available for deeper questions
→ Save **Vision 2050** for after they're already committed

### If you're talking to academics/researchers:
→ Lead with **Nature Food article** (peer-reviewed science)
→ Reference **G20 report** (shows policy relevance)
→ Share **Architecture** for theoretical framework
→ The combination shows: peer-reviewed science + major policy bodies + coherent theory

### If you're having a bad day:
→ Read **Vision 2050** to remember why this matters
→ Read **Architecture Part VI** (Conclusion) for the emotional core
→ Remember: **G20 report** shows the world is waking up to these problems

### If you're curious about Björn's thinking frameworks:
→ Read **spiral-dynamics.txt** (but only if genuinely interested)
→ Follow the warnings in the file religiously
→ Never use it as a communication tool externally

## Optional Deep Dives

**For persuasive writing:**
Read Architecture of the Open Hand, then practice explaining it in 3 sentences:
1. "We're trapped in systems that force destructive choices even when people want peace."
2. "GGF redesigns the architecture so cooperation becomes rational, not suicidal."
3. "We're building working prototypes, not writing manifestos."

**For grant applications with maximum impact:**
Combine all three validation sources:
1. **Theory:** Architecture of the Open Hand (Part IV)
2. **Science:** Nature Food article methodology
3. **Authority:** G20 report statistics and policy alignment

Example: "Recent peer-reviewed research (Nature Food, 2024) demonstrates that behavioral interventions require systemic economic mechanisms. The November 2025 G20 Global Inequality Report confirms that 83% of countries face high inequality driven by structural policy choices, recommending reforms that align with our approach..."

**For academic partnerships:**
Skim Nature Food article, note the methodology, be ready to discuss how Hearts currency operationalizes their findings. The G20 report adds policy relevance to the academic research.

**For maintaining motivation:**
Keep Vision 2050 handy. When municipal bureaucracy crushes your soul, remember: the G20 report shows the world is waking up to these problems. You're not fighting alone, and you're ahead of the curve.

## What's NOT Here (But You Might Want Later)

These documents focus on the "why" and "how" at the conceptual level. For the "what" (concrete proposals), see:
- **03-Portfolio/** for all TAK documents
- **00-START-HERE/** for operational summaries

---

## A Note on Using This Material

**Do:**
- Reference these ideas in grant applications
- Share PDFs with interested partners (except spiral-dynamics.txt)
- Use quotes in persuasive writing
- Cite Nature Food article and G20 report as validation
- Combine sources for maximum credibility (theory + science + authority)
- Read spiral-dynamics.txt if curious (but follow its warnings)

**Don't:**
- Lead with philosophy (lead with concrete proposals)
- Expect bureaucrats to read 70-page reports (extract key statistics)
- Use Vision 2050 in funding applications (too utopian)
- Get lost in theory when you should be executing
- Dump the full G20 report on people (use summary pages or extract stats)
- **Ever mention Spiral Dynamics to external stakeholders** (sounds like jargon/categorizing)
- **Ever use color-coded language in meetings** ("Blue/Green conflict" → "torn between rules and inclusion")

**Remember:** These documents exist to support the work, not replace it. The work is in the `01-WORKING-DOCS/` folder. This is the fuel that keeps you going.
