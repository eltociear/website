# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v2.1)

This document is the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance designed to foster collective flow and minimize egoic friction.

---

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
Humanity faces interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants, requiring adaptive, inclusive governance grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors collaboratively designing systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
GGF’s success is measured by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves, assessed through a holistic index: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI). Labs define 2-3 specific, measurable indicators aligned with LMCI to track their impact.

### Our Foundation: Integrated & Evolving Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of all levels of human consciousness, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.
- **Coral:** Actively creating space for paradigm-breaking innovation, fostering unforeseen models of governance and collaboration that may challenge this framework itself. This ethos ensures GGF remains a catalyst for continuous evolution, avoiding dogmatism.

## 1. Core Principles

These principles guide GGF’s internal operations, designed to enable collective flow and reduce egoic attachment.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs, with a Stewards Circle coordinating network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, with rotating contributors selected via open nomination and consent-based processes, intervening at least quarterly to critique strategies, propose creative alternatives, and ensure balance between critique and collaboration. Interventions may be anonymous to encourage candid feedback. The Office operates as a rotating function, potentially integrated with Guardian Council responsibilities, to maintain agility.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize free, open-source, privacy-respecting, decentralized tools, allowing pragmatic use of proprietary tools when necessary, guided by a selection protocol (see Section 3.5).

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” ensures dissolution or transition when the mission is fulfilled, with knowledge transfer via open-source licensing for long-term projects.

### Principle of Reversibility
Decisions are reversible where possible, with review periods and rollback plans to adapt to unintended consequences, supporting epistemic humility.

### Relational Integrity
We commit to fostering psychological safety and compassionate collaboration:
- **Assume Good Faith:** Contributors assume positive intent in disagreements.
- **Compassionate Communication:** Interactions use Nonviolent Communication, focusing on needs and feelings, reviewed for cultural sensitivity to decolonize knowledge and prioritize non-Western governance models, including explicit references to Indigenous governance principles such as consensus-based decision-making and relational accountability.
- **Mediation Support:** Labs designate trained mediators to facilitate conversations before escalation.

### Climate Justice & Environmental Stewardship
All operations prioritize climate justice, ensuring environmental impact assessments are integrated into decision-making, funding allocations, and tool selections to minimize carbon footprints and promote ecological resilience.

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units—designed to minimize egoic attachment through fluid roles and collective ownership.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains, organized as Core, Emergent, or Innovation Labs (see Section 7).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Labs define internal processes, aligning with Charter principles.
- **Scaling:** Labs exceeding a dynamic size threshold (e.g., based on project complexity or contributor count, typically 20+) split per the Fractal Scaling Protocol (see Section 3.7).
- **Feedback Loops:** Labs provide quarterly feedback to the Stewards Circle via reports and open forums.
- **Accountability:** Labs undergo a Lab Health Review Protocol (see Section 3.13) to support performance and alignment.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources, recognized for work, not titles.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, project oversight, and monitoring burnout, encouraging collective breaks between sprints.
- **Stewards Circle:** A rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
  5. Coordinating external threat responses (see Section 3.8).
  - **Term Limits:** Stewards serve two-year terms, with one year off before re-eligibility.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab managing interactions with centralized systems:
  - **Mandate:** Insulate Labs from bureaucratic constraints, handle legal incorporation, banking, contracts, compliance, international legal monitoring, and annual environmental impact assessments of GGF operations.
  - **Operation:** Operates autonomously, reporting transparently to the Stewards Circle.
- **Fork Mediation Guild:** A specialized Lab facilitating equitable asset splits and dialogue during forks, including intellectual property disputes, ensuring relational integrity (see Section 6.1). This Guild may merge with the Support Guild if operational overlap occurs to streamline functions.
- **Guardian Council:** A diverse group (3-5 members) upholding GGF principles without executive authority.
  - **Selection:** Chosen via a two-stage process: (1) open nomination accessible to all contributors, followed by (2) a community vote requiring a two-thirds majority, ensuring democratic legitimacy. Candidates are evaluated based on demonstrated wisdom (e.g., conflict resolution experience, cross-cultural understanding) and alignment with GGF principles (e.g., commitment to LMCI).
  - **Terms:** Staggered three-year terms.
