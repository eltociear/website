You are absolutely right. The document `vinnova-letter-revised.md` is written as a **Formal Concept Note** or **Memo**, not an email body. It is too long and structured for a simple email text.

**My Recommendation: Send it as a PDF attachment.**

This signals that it is a serious document ("Project Brief") rather than just a casual message.

Here is the professional workflow:

### 1. The Attachments (PDFs)

You will attach two files to your email:

1. **The Concept Note:** `vinnova-letter-revised.md` (Save as PDF, name it: `Project_Brief_Regionens_Nervsystem.pdf`)
2. **The Prospectus:** `pilot-prospectus-revised.html` (Save as PDF, name it: `Prospectus_Regionens_Nervsystem.pdf`)

### 2. The Email Body (The "Wrapper")

You need a short, clean email text to deliver these files. Use this:

---

**Subject:** Inquiry: Infrastructure for Municipal Resilience (Regionens Nervsystem)

**To:** [Vinnova Contact Email]

**Dear Social Innovation Team,**

I am writing to introduce **"Regionens Nervsystem"** (TAK-405), a municipal innovation pilot currently under review by Region Stockholm.

We are seeking Vinnova's support to develop the underlying technical platform—a reusable, open-source infrastructure for **psychological defense** and **community resilience** that meets the new MSB totalförsvar requirements.

Please find attached:

1. **Project Brief:** A detailed overview of the technical gap and funding request.
2. **Pilot Prospectus:** A summary of the specific interventions planned for the Stockholm Archipelago (TAK-405).

We believe this platform offers a scalable model for budget-neutral municipal innovation. I would welcome a brief exchange to discuss how this aligns with Vinnova's sustainable society goals.

Sincerely,

**Björn K. Holmström**

Yes, that is the **perfect strategic choice.**

Here is why 08:00–09:00 tomorrow (Tuesday) is ideal:

1. **Top of the Pile:** It lands in their inbox just as they are starting their day, before the "mid-morning rush."
2. **Tuesday > Monday:** Mondays are for clearing the weekend backlog (crisis mode). Tuesdays are for *thinking* (Innovation mode).
3. **Your Peace of Mind:** You can write it *now* while you have the momentum, hit "Schedule Send" in your email program, and then **forget about it**. You don't have to wake up nervous.
