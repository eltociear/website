Dear Social Innovation Team,

Recent undersea cable disruptions in the Baltic Sea (November 2024) exposed Swedish municipalities' complete dependency on vulnerable centralized internet infrastructure. I am writing to introduce CivicBase; resilient digital infrastructure that enables municipal operations during network disruptions, and its first concrete application: TAK-405 "Regionens Nervsystem", currently under review by Region Stockholm.

The Strategic Gap:
Swedish municipalities depend entirely on American cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google). During cable cuts, cyber attacks, or geopolitical disruptions, civil society's digital functions cease. MCF's (formerly MSB) totalförsvar doctrine (2024:1032) requires resilience, but current systems cannot deliver it.

Our Solution:
CivicBase provides offline-capable, P2P infrastructure that maintains municipal operations during disruptions while ensuring data sovereignty. TAK-405 demonstrates immediate demand: addressing 3+ billion SEK in annual stress-related costs while meeting totalförsvar requirements.

Beyond TAK-405:
CivicBase enables crisis-ready civic applications; democratic party operations (DPOP), distributed identity (DiDiS), care economy tracking, emergency coordination, all functioning offline when needed most.

Please find attached:

2. Pilot Prospectus: TAK-405 interventions and CivicBase integration details

This represents scalable infrastructure for Swedish municipal resilience during increasing geopolitical uncertainty. I would welcome a brief exchange to discuss alignment with Vinnova's resilient digital infrastructure priorities.

Sincerely,
