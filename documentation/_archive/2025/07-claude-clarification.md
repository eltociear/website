Gemini's consolidation is **strategically correct for your constraints**, and I should have started there. Here's why:

**Gemini is right:**
1. **You can't hire 5 people in Q1** - Budget and coordination overhead would kill you
2. **The "shield" must come first** - Without someone handling external interface, you'll burn out before you get anywhere
3. **Verksamhetsledare (Executive Director) is the critical role** - This person IS the project's public face while you're the architect

**My original list was:**
- Correct for a **funded startup with $500K+ runway**
- Wrong for your **2026 Q1 reality** where you're bootstrapping

**The right hybrid approach:**

**Phase 1 (Q1 2026): Minimal Viable Team**

1. **Verksamhetsledare / Co-Founder** (Week 1-4) - €40-50K/year or revenue share
   - **External:** Presents to municipalities, writes grant applications, manages stakeholder relationships
   - **Internal:** Coordinates consultants, manages budget, handles admin
   - **Profile:** Former municipal official or NGO director, comfortable with both bureaucracy and innovation
   - **This person protects your health and energy**

2. **Technical Lead** (Week 8-12) - Part-time consultant initially, €30-40K/year
   - Builds Hearts/Leaves prototype
   - Could be you initially if needed, but goal is to hand off

3. **Legal/Governance Consultant** (As needed basis) - €10-15K for Q1 deliverables
   - Not full-time hire
   - Verksamhetsledare manages this relationship

**Phase 2 (Q3-Q4 2026): Scale when funded**

4. **Communications/Narrative Strategist** - Once you have municipal interest
5. **Additional technical capacity** - Once prototype proves viable

**Total Q1 budget:** €60-80K (achievable from initial grants/support)

**Critical insight from Gemini:**
> "You cannot wait until Week 17 to hire the person who coordinates everything."

This is exactly right. The Verksamhetsledare **enables everything else**. Without them, you're doing all the coordination yourself, which defeats the purpose.

**Your role clarity:**
- **NOT:** Traveling to meetings, presenting to municipal boards, managing schedules
- **YES:** Deep work on architecture, video call Q&A sessions (15-20 min), reviewing technical specifications
- **YES:** Writing white papers, refining frameworks, strategic thinking
- **NOT:** Grant application bureaucracy (Verksamhetsledare handles, you review)

**How this protects your health:**
- You work when your energy allows
- Verksamhetsledare handles all "must attend at 14:00 on Tuesday" obligations
- You join critical meetings via video for expertise, then leave
- Your value is **architectural depth**, not **executive presence**

**Gemini's model is correct for 2026.** My 5-person list becomes the **2027 team** once you have pilot funding secured.

The Verksamhetsledare is your first and most critical hire. Everything else flows from having that shield in place.
