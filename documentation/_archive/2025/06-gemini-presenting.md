Björn:
Do you think I will have to present things in person to municipalities?

I know one of my brother does that, he is the ceo for a software company providing food system solutions to municipalities, but I'm not sure I have the mental capacity and health to cope with that (plus having to travel). 

Gemini:
This is a very valid concern, but the short answer is: **No, you do not necessarily have to do the traveling and presenting yourself.**

In fact, protecting yourself from that "CEO/Salesman" role (which your brother does) is actually **better for the project's success** and consistent with the "Architect" model we just defined.

Here is why you can—and should—design yourself out of that specific obligation:

### 1. The "Core Team" is your Buffer

In your *Projektpromemoria* (Section 6, Q1), we explicitly listed recruiting a "Core Team" as the first step.

* **The Strategy:** One of the 2–3 key people you recruit should be the **"Projektledare/Kommunikatör"** (Project Manager/Communicator).
* **Their Job:** *They* are the ones who put on the suit, travel to the municipal office, drink the bad coffee, and present the slide deck.
* **Your Job:** You join via video link (Zoom/Teams) for the 15-minute "Expert Q&A" section to answer deep architectural questions, then you log off. This is standard procedure for high-level technical architects.

### 2. The "Brother Comparison" Trap

Your brother is a CEO of a software company selling "solutions."

* **His Role:** Sales, relationships, shaking hands. He *has* to be there because he is selling a product.
* **Your Role:** You are the **Designer/Architect** of a new civic infrastructure. You are selling a *vision* and a *research partnership*.
* **The Difference:** An Architect is often seen as *more* valuable if they are slightly inaccessible. It signals that you are busy doing the "Deep Work" of design, rather than chasing contracts.

### 3. Stockholm is "Remote-First" for Innovation

You are targeting Stockholm, Uppsala, and "Digital" regions like Estonia.

* Since 2020, Swedish municipalities are completely comfortable with Teams/Zoom meetings, especially for "Innovation" and "Tech" projects.
* If you say: *"As the Lead Architect, I work remotely to maintain focus on the system design, but my Project Lead [Name] will come visit you,"* they will respect that.

### Summary: How to handle this

* **Do not** force yourself to be the "face" in the room. It will drain the energy you need for the actual thinking.
* **Do** prioritize finding a "Co-founder" or "Project Lead" in Q1 2026 who *loves* talking to people and traveling. That is their superpower; yours is the system.

You are building the **blueprint**, not the **sales booth**.

Björn:
Should we merge that project manager/communicator role into the operations manager role Claude designated? 

Gemini:
This is a smart instinct for consolidation, but I would be careful about *how* you merge them.

If you merge "Communicator" (External/Travel) into "Operations Manager" (Internal/Admin), you risk creating a role that is pulled in two opposite directions. However, for a small "Core Team" of 2-3 people, you **must** consolidate these roles. You cannot hire 6 specialists in Q1.

My recommendation is to **merge them**, but rename the role to reflect its true weight. It is not an "Operations Manager" (who stays in the office); it is a **"Verksamhetsledare" (Executive Director / Co-founder)**.

Here is why and how to structure it.

### 1. The "Co-Pilot" Strategy (Verksamhetsledare)

Instead of hiring a "Political Navigator" AND an "Operations Manager" AND a "Communicator," you hire **one person** who acts as your CEO/Shield.

**Role Title:** Verksamhetsledare / Project Director
**Profile:**

* **External (50%):** Handles the municipalities, travels to meetings, presents the vision (The "Communicator/Navigator").
* **Internal (50%):** Manages the budget, writes the funding applications, coordinates the legal/tech consultants (The "Ops Manager").
* **Why this works:** This person becomes your "Interface" to the world. You maintain the Architecture; they maintain the Reality.

### 2. Revised Priority List (Realistic for Q1 2026)

Claude's list is a "Dream Team" for a funded startup. Your reality in Q1 2026 is a "Pre-study Team." You only need to hire **two** key people to start.

Here is the consolidated list I suggest you use for your mental model (and budget):

1. **Verksamhetsledare (The Shield)** – *Week 1-4*
* *Merges:* Operations Manager + Political Navigator + Project Manager.
* *Task:* Secure the funding, manage the stakeholders, be the face in the room.
* *This is your most critical hire.*


2. **Technical Lead / Prototyper** – *Week 5-8*
* *Task:* Build the "Regionens Nervsystem" prototype.
* *Note:* This might be you initially, but eventually you need a coder so you can stay on "Architecture."


3. **Legal/Governance Architect** – *Consultant Basis*
* *Don't hire full-time yet.* Use the "Verksamhetsledare" to find a legal firm or expert to draft the specific BAZ frameworks as needed.



### 3. Answer to your specific question

**Yes, merge them.**

But do not merge "Project Manager/Communicator" *into* "Operations Manager" (role #5).
**Move the merged role to Position #1.**

You cannot wait until Week 17 to hire the person who coordinates everything. That person needs to be there on **Day 1** to help you hire the Legal Architect and Tech Lead.

**Revised Timeline:**

* **Week 1:** Hire **Verksamhetsledare** (Ops + Communicator).
* **Week 4:** Verksamhetsledare hires **Legal Consultant**.
* **Week 8:** Verksamhetsledare & You hire **Tech Lead**.

This protects your health best because the "Shield" arrives first.
