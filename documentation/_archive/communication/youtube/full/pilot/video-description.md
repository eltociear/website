Yes, you are absolutely correct. That's a crucial clarification for practical application on YouTube.

The **video description** is the primary and most effective place for your links. My suggestion for a final screen should be seen as a visual reminder that *points* the viewer to the description.

Here’s the refined, best-practice strategy.

## ## Why the Description is Key

You are right to question this. Placing links in the video description is the standard and most effective method for several reasons:
* **Clickability:** Links in the description are clickable. Text on a final screen is not (unless you use YouTube's specific "end screen element" feature, which is still less direct).
* **Convention:** Viewers are trained to look in the description for more information, downloads, or resources.
* **Accessibility:** The description is always accessible on all devices (desktop, mobile, TV) and is readable by screen readers.

## ## The "Best of Both Worlds" Approach

The optimal strategy is to use the end of your video to verbally direct people to the clickable links in the description.

1.  **Keep the Verbal Cue in the Script:** The final lines of your script should explicitly say:
    > "...you can find the links to the book, the white paper, and the Spiralize.org website **in the description below.**"

2.  **Use a Simple End Screen:** The final screen of your video should be a clean, branded image with your key website URLs, but its main job is to visually reinforce the verbal call to action.

3.  **Craft a Clear Video Description:** This is where the action happens. Structure it for clarity so viewers can easily find what they're looking for.
