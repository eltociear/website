The Bill is Coming Due.

If you look at your organization today—the gridlocked decisions, the fraying processes, the burnout in your team—it's easy to blame leadership.

We assume smarter people at the top would fix the machine.

We're wrong.

The machine isn't broken because the operators are bad.
The machine is broken because it is bankrupt.

We are not facing a crisis of leadership. We are facing a civilizational Margin Call.

For 50 years, we've been running Stage Orange software (growth, extraction, competition) on planetary hardware that is now full. We purchased stability on credit, moving the costs of carbon, inequality, and institutional decay "off the balance sheet."

But in a closed system, there is no "externality." There is only "later."

And later has arrived.

I just published a new manifesto introducing Developmental Debt—the liability we accrue when we use simple thinking (Tier 1) to manage complex realities (Tier 2):

📊 Blue Debt (Rigidity Tax): Prioritizing Order over Adaptation
📊 Orange Debt (Externalization): Prioritizing Profit over Resilience  
📊 Green Debt (Consensus Tax): Prioritizing Harmony over Competence

The compound interest is now due. The "polycrisis" is simply our credit cards maxing out simultaneously.

We have two options:
1. Hard Default → Chaos and collapse
2. Strategic Restructuring → Upgrade our operating system

This isn't a moral lecture. It's an audit.

I've also released a Developmental Debt Calculator (free Excel tool) so you can calculate your organization's actual liability.

The window for restructuring is closing. The audit is complete. The numbers don't lie.

Who is ready to restructure?
