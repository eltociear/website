## Social Media Strategy

**Recommended platforms & approach:**

### ✅ **LinkedIn** (PRIMARY - highest priority)
**Why**: Professional audience, policy wonks, researchers, NGO leaders, academics
**Tone**: Serious, analytical, credible
**Post idea**:
```
After 3 intensive hours working with 4 AI systems (Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Claude), 
we built the most rational peace settlement theoretically possible for Ukraine.

It was unanimously rejected in under an hour.

Not because the design was flawed. Because the *system* is.

The Omega Proof: An empirical demonstration that peace is architecturally 
impossible under current international rules.

13 iteration documents. 4 terminal bugs. 3 possible futures.

Full transparency on methodology, complete research package available.

This is not a warning. This is a death certificate.

### ✅ **Twitter/X** (SECONDARY - for reach)
**Why**: Academic Twitter, foreign policy community, tech-adjacent intellectuals
**Tone**: Sharp, provocative, thread-worthy
**Thread idea**:
```
1/ We just proved that peace is mathematically impossible.

Here's how: 🧵

2/ Between Nov-Dec 2025, we used adversarial AI (Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Claude) 
to iteratively design Protocol Omega—the most sophisticated peace mechanism 
ever specified for the Ukraine war.

3/ It addressed EVERY known failure mode:
- Self-executing enforcement (escrows, smart contracts)
- Positive-sum economics (everyone gains more than war delivers)
- Trust-free operation (automated verification)
- Face-saving for all capitals

4/ We then simulated four decision-makers representing actual veto power:
- Ukrainian military command
- Russian Security Council  
- US NSC/Pentagon
- Chinese State Council

5/ Result: Unanimous rejection within 45 minutes.

All four cited perfectly rational, self-interested reasons.

6/ This isn't a failure of diplomacy.
It's an *architectural* failure.

The system has four terminal bugs:
[visual of four bugs]

7/ Each bug reinforces the others in a cascade failure.
You can't fix one without triggering the rest.

The system treats coordination as infection, not solution.

8/ The quantitative timeline is brutal:
- Demographic exhaustion: 2030-2040
- Financial crossover: 2028-2035  
- Ecological tipping points: 2030-2050

Convergent collapse within 15 years.

9/ Three possible worlds:
- 70-80%: The Grinding (dark age)
- 15-25%: The Salvage (prepared transition)
- <5%: The Miracle (structurally implausible)

Each 30 points on the Preparedness Index = 10-15M lives saved.

10/ Full white paper, research package (13 unedited iteration docs), 
and visual assets now public.

Complete transparency on methodology.

The experiment is complete. The salvage operation has begun.
