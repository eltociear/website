Gemini:
Yes, finding the right people to take a look at your work is the perfect next step. Given your current state, a large conference presentation would be counterproductive. A quiet, targeted, and strategic email outreach campaign is the ideal approach. It allows you to stay in control, manage your energy, and make significant progress from your keyboard.

You are absolutely right that the project cannot be perfected in a vacuum. The goal now is not to achieve perfection, but to **start a conversation** with the right people who can offer feedback, become allies, and help you find pathways to resources.

Here is a practical, step-by-step plan for how you can approach this.

---
### **Step 1: Assemble Your "Pitch Package"**

Before you send a single email, you need a concise and powerful set of materials. Sending a 50-page white paper in a cold email will almost never be read. You need to create a "funnel" that draws people in.

1.  **The One-Page Executive Summary:** Create a single, visually clean page that summarizes the grand vision. It should introduce the core problem (the crisis of integration) and the core solution: **The Triumvirate of Hardware, Heart, and Nervous System**. This is your high-level hook.

2.  **The "Gateway" Document:** Choose **one** document from your collection that is the most accessible and compelling for a new reader. Based on our work, this should be the **"Breaking Gridlock" blog post outline** (once drafted) or, for a more data-focused audience, the **"Executive Summary for the Skeptic"**. This is the piece you will attach to most of your emails.

3.  **The Link to the "Cathedral":** A single, clean link to your GGF website, where all the other frameworks and white papers are hosted. This is for the small percentage of people who are immediately captivated and want to explore the entire system.

4.  **The "One-Liner":** A single sentence that captures the essence of the project. For example: "The Global Governance Frameworks is a practical blueprint for upgrading our world's 'operating systems'—our institutions, ethics, and economies—to meet the challenges of the 21st century."

### **Step 2: Identify Your Target Audience in "Rings"**

Don't try to reach everyone at once. Think of your outreach in three strategic rings, moving from the safest to the most ambitious.

* **Ring 1: The Allies (Friendly Feedback)**
    * **Who:** A small group of 5-10 trusted colleagues, mentors, or friends whose opinion you respect.
    * **The Goal:** Not to get them to "join," but to get **feedback on your Pitch Package.** Is the one-pager clear? Is the Gateway Document compelling? This is a low-stakes way to refine your materials before you approach strangers.

* **Ring 2: The Kindred Spirits (Strategic Alliances)**
    * **Who:** This is your most important target list. These are organizations and thinkers who are already working on adjacent problems and are likely to immediately grasp the significance of your work.
    * **Examples:**
        * **The Long Now Foundation:** They focus on long-term thinking; your framework provides the governance for it.
        * **Doughnut Economics Action Lab (Kate Raworth):** They have a new economic model; your framework provides the governance and social fabric to implement it.
        * **The Aspen Institute's Weave Project:** They focus on social cohesion; your **Social Fabric Framework** is a direct, systematic approach to their core mission.
        * **Progressive Policy Institutes:** Organizations that are looking for big, systemic solutions beyond incrementalism.

* **Ring 3: The Influencers & Funders (Scaling Up)**
    * **Who:** Progressive foundations with an interest in systems change, specific journalists or podcasters who cover "big ideas," and academic departments focused on governance or systems theory.
    * **The Goal:** This is the long-term goal. You only approach this ring after you've refined your pitch with Rings 1 & 2 and perhaps found an ally or two who can make an introduction for you.

### **Step 3: Craft a Simple, Powerful Email**

Your email should be short, respectful of their time, and make a clear, low-friction "ask."

* **Subject:** A Practical Blueprint for Regenerative Governance
* **Opening:** Start with your one-liner. "Dear [Name], I'm writing to you because of your work on [their specific area]. I have developed the Global Governance Frameworks, a practical blueprint for upgrading our world's operating systems to meet 21st-century challenges."
* **The Core Idea:** "At its heart, the project integrates three key systems: institutional **Hardware** (reforming global bodies), an ethical **Heart** (grounded in Indigenous wisdom and social cohesion), and an adaptive **Nervous System** (for effective coordination)."
* **The Ask (Crucial):** Make it easy for them to say yes. "The full body of work is extensive, but I've attached a **one-page summary** that outlines the core vision. If that resonates, the attached **7-minute article** offers a practical introduction to our core decision-making methodology."
* **The Close:** "Any feedback or thoughts you might have would be immensely valuable. You can explore the full ecosystem at [Link to GGF Website]. Thank you for your time and for the important work you do."

### **Step 4: Define Your Goal**

This is the most important step for your mental well-being. The goal of this campaign is **not** to get everyone to say yes or to secure funding tomorrow.

The goal is to **start conversations and find your first 1-3 true allies.**

That's it. You are sending out signals to find the other people on your frequency. Most emails will be ignored. A few will get a polite "no." But a handful will get a response that says, "I've been thinking about this for years. Let's talk." Those are the people you are looking for. They will become your collaborators, your advocates, and the first members of the GGF community.

This is a patient, quiet, and powerful way forward that respects your current needs while moving this vital work into the world.

Björn:
Should I include the documents as pdfs?

Gemini:
Based on modern outreach best practices and the goal of making it as easy as possible for busy people to engage with your work, here is my recommendation:

**No, you should not attach PDFs to your initial emails.** Instead, you should create polished web versions and link to them.

Here’s a detailed clarification of why and how to approach this.

### The Rationale: A Web-First Approach

The primary goal of your outreach is to **reduce friction**. You want to make it effortless for someone to see your idea in the first 10 seconds. PDFs, while professional, introduce significant friction:

1.  **Security Concerns:** Many busy professionals are trained not to open attachments from people they don't know well due to the risk of malware. Your email could be deleted without being read.
2.  **Poor Mobile Experience:** The majority of emails are first opened on a phone. PDFs are notoriously difficult to read on mobile screens, requiring pinching and zooming. A poorly formatted first impression can cause someone to abandon the document.
3.  **Higher Psychological Barrier:** Clicking a link feels like a low-commitment invitation to browse. Downloading an attachment feels like a task and a commitment to store a file.

### The Recommended Strategy: Link to Web Pages, Offer PDFs as a Download

The best approach is to get the best of both worlds.

**Step 1: Create Polished Web Versions**
* **Executive Summary Page:** Create a dedicated, beautifully designed, and easy-to-read page on your GGF website for the Executive Summary. Treat it like a core landing page.
* **Blog Post:** Ensure the "Stuck in a Hard Place?" article is published on your website in a clean, readable format with the header image.

**Step 2: Offer the PDF as a Secondary Option**
* On both the Executive Summary page and the blog post page, include a prominent and well-designed button or link that says:
    > **"Download as PDF for offline reading and sharing"**

This strategy is superior because it:
* **Maximizes Engagement:** A simple link in your email is the lowest-friction way to get someone's eyes on your content.
* **Provides a Professional Asset:** For those who are genuinely interested, the PDF is available for them to save, print, or share with their colleagues. It serves as a professional, permanent artifact of your work.
* **Drives Traffic to Your Site:** It brings influential people directly to your website, where they can easily explore other frameworks and get a feel for the entire project.

By creating web versions for the initial contact and offering PDFs as a downloadable option, you combine the low-friction accessibility of a link with the professional permanence of a well-formatted document.
