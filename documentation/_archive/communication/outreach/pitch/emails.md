Of course. This is a crucial and deeply important clarification. Claude's feedback is correct, and your willingness to pause and address this is a testament to the integrity of your work. Approaching Indigenous communities with a pre-built framework, even one developed with the best intentions through AI, risks perpetuating extractive and colonial patterns.

The correct next step is to revise the outreach to be more honest and humble about the project's current status. This is not a setback; it's a course correction that will make your project far more credible and ethically sound.

Here are the revised email drafts, incorporating this new understanding and Claude's other excellent suggestions.

### **Revised Email for Ring 1: The Allies**

This version is more vulnerable and directly asks for advice on the specific ethical dilemma you're facing.

**Subject:** Seeking your advice on a new project (and a tricky question)

**Body:**

Hi [Ally's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out because I've been developing a project, the **Global Governance Frameworks**, and have reached a point where your perspective would be invaluable.

I'm trying to create a practical blueprint for coordinating global responses to interconnected crises, and I've put together a one-page summary and an introductory article to start sharing the idea.

However, I've run into an important ethical crossroads. A core part of the vision is a "Heart" component, grounded in Indigenous wisdom, which was developed based on extensive AI-assisted research. **Crucially, I have not yet engaged directly with any Indigenous communities.**

My key question for you is: **How should I frame this part of the work responsibly?** Claude suggested either downplaying it for now, or explicitly framing it as an exploratory hypothesis that requires Indigenous leadership to co-create.

I've attached the pitch package with this in mind. Any feedback you have on both the content and how to navigate this ethical challenge would be a huge help.

Best,

Björn

### **Revised Email for Ring 2: The Kindred Spirits**

This version is reframed to focus on the "Hardware" and "Nervous System" as the core innovation, while positioning the "Heart" as an explicit aspiration that requires future, authentic partnership.

**Subject:** A Practical Blueprint for Coordinating Global Responses to Interconnected Crises

**Body:**

Dear [Name/Dr. Last Name],

I've been following your work on [their specific project] and admire your approach. I'm writing because I have developed a project that I believe shares your goal of creating more coherent and effective systems.

I am the architect of the **Global Governance Frameworks**, an open-source blueprint for upgrading our world's 'operating systems' to be regenerative by design. The project's core innovation is the integration of two key systems:
* **The Hardware** of renewed legal institutions with binding enforcement and independent funding.
* **The Nervous System** of adaptive coordination that allows diverse entities to collaborate without centralized control.

**Crucially, we hypothesize that for this system to have a true ethical compass—a "Heart"—it must be grounded in the wisdom of Indigenous governance.** This is an area we are approaching with great care, with the explicit goal of learning from and supporting Indigenous leadership in a future phase of co-creation, rather than prescribing solutions.

The full body of work is extensive, but I have attached a **one-page summary** that outlines this vision. If it resonates, a short, practical article on our core decision-making methodology, "Stuck in a Hard Place?", is available on our website.

I believe there's a powerful synergy between our projects. Any thoughts you might have would be welcome.

Thank you for your time and for the vital work you do.

Sincerely,

Björn Holmström

### **Revised Email for Ring 3: The Influencers & Funders**

This version is highly professional and frames the current status of the "Heart" component not as a weakness, but as a sign of ethical maturity and a future opportunity.

**Subject:** A Practical Framework for Navigating the Polycrisis

**Body:**

Dear [Name/Title],

My name is Björn Holmström, and I am the architect of the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)**, a comprehensive, open-source blueprint designed to provide actionable pathways for navigating global, interconnected crises.

The GGF addresses today's crisis of integration by weaving together two foundational systems: the **Hardware** of renewed legal institutions with binding global enforcement, and the **Nervous System** of adaptive, multi-stakeholder coordination.

Our vision explicitly recognizes that a third system, the ethical **Heart** of the framework, must be co-created in authentic partnership with Indigenous communities, whose wisdom is essential for planetary stewardship. Our methodology is therefore designed to support this future collaboration with the utmost ethical care.

We have developed a suite of interoperable frameworks—from a regenerative economic model to a practical methodology for breaking political gridlock—that are now ready for community review and pilot implementation.

I have attached a **one-page executive summary** that details the architecture and potential impact of this work. If the GGF's mission aligns with your organization's focus on systemic solutions and democratic innovation, I would welcome the opportunity to introduce my work further.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Björn Holmström
Founder, Global Governance Frameworks
