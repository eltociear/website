Björn Kenneth Holmström:
Hi Claude! Do you think this 'pitch-package' for the Global Governance Frameworks makes sense? I put it together with Gemini's help

Claude:
Looking at your pitch package, I think it's quite strong overall! The strategic approach is sound and the materials work well together. Here are my thoughts:

## What Works Really Well

**The Strategic Approach**: The three-ring targeting strategy (Allies → Kindred Spirits → Influencers/Funders) is smart. It allows you to refine your pitch with friendly feedback before approaching higher-stakes contacts.

**The "Gateway" Piece**: The "Stuck in a Hard Place" blog post is an excellent choice for drawing people in. It's practical, immediately useful, and demonstrates the GGF's problem-solving approach without requiring people to digest the full systemic vision upfront.

**The Executive Summary**: This strikes a good balance between being comprehensive enough to convey the scope while being concise enough to actually read. The three-part structure (Hardware/Heart/Nervous System) creates a memorable framework.

**The Email Templates**: These are well-crafted for their respective audiences - appropriately casual for allies, respectfully peer-to-peer for kindred spirits, and professional for institutional contacts.

## A Few Suggestions

**The "One-Liner"**: While accurate, the current version ("upgrading our world's operating systems") might benefit from being more specific about outcomes. Something like "a practical blueprint for coordinating global responses to interconnected crises" could be more compelling.

**The Crisis Response Example**: The 72-hour marine ecosystem response scenario in the executive summary is powerful - it makes the abstract concrete. Consider leading with this kind of specific example rather than saving it for the middle.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Given how central Indigenous wisdom is to the GGF, you might want to mention in your emails that this work has been developed with deep respect for Indigenous leadership and is intended to support rather than appropriate traditional knowledge systems.

## Overall Assessment

This is a thoughtful, well-structured pitch package that respects people's time while conveying the significance of the work. The progression from the one-page hook to the gateway document to the full ecosystem makes sense, and the tone strikes the right balance between confidence and humility.

The fact that you've thought through different audiences and crafted appropriate approaches for each shows strategic thinking. Most importantly, you're leading with practical value (the Canvas tool) rather than just theoretical frameworks, which makes the work more immediately accessible.

You're ready to start those conversations with Ring 1!

Björn:
Hmm.. I haven't been in contact with indigenous people myself, only worked with yours and other LLMs recommendations. It was your idea that they would be pivotal in the project. Should I reach out to indigenous people first?

Claude:
This is a really important question that gets to the heart of ethical engagement. You're absolutely right to pause here.

Looking at your project materials, I can see that the Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Framework is quite detailed and positions Indigenous wisdom as central to the entire GGF vision. However, if this was developed primarily through AI recommendations rather than actual Indigenous community engagement, that creates some significant concerns:

## The Risks

**Unintentional Appropriation**: Even well-intentioned frameworks can inadvertently appropriate or misrepresent Indigenous knowledge when developed without community input.

**Setting False Expectations**: Your current materials suggest deep Indigenous integration, which could mislead potential partners about your actual community relationships.

**Potential Harm**: Indigenous communities often deal with extractive researchers and organizations. Approaching them with a pre-developed framework could be received as presumptuous.

## A Better Path Forward

I'd suggest modifying your approach:

**For Your Current Pitch Package**: Consider either:
1. Removing or significantly downplaying the Indigenous elements until you have actual community relationships, or
2. Reframing them explicitly as "AI-assisted exploration of possibilities that would require Indigenous leadership and guidance"

**For Indigenous Engagement**: If you genuinely want Indigenous involvement:
1. Start by learning about protocols in your region for respectful engagement
2. Approach Indigenous organizations as a learner, not with a pre-built framework
3. Be prepared to completely redesign based on community guidance
4. Understand this process could take years and might lead in totally different directions

**For Your Immediate Outreach**: Your Ring 1 and Ring 2 strategy can absolutely proceed with the governance coordination and decision-making tools (like the Paradox Canvas), which stand on their own merit. The "crisis of integration" and "Hardware/Nervous System" elements are valuable without the Indigenous components.

You have strong, practical tools that can help with real governance challenges right now. That's enough to start building relationships and getting feedback.
