# What We Would Do If We Were Trump, To Make America Great Again

America is strong. America is proud. America is ready to lead.

But let's be honest: the old playbook of "greatness" has run its course. Factories closed. Main Streets hollowed out. Families torn apart by addiction. Young people drowning in debt. Veterans forgotten. Our country has been sold short by a system rigged for the wealthy few.

If we were Trump—if we truly wanted to make America great again—we wouldn't look backward. We'd build forward. We'd double down on what America does best: innovation, resilience, and freedom.

**Greatness today doesn't mean coal mines and oil rigs. It means clean energy that makes us independent forever. It doesn't mean billionaires getting richer while working families struggle. It means every worker, every veteran, every parent getting a fair shot. It doesn't mean shouting "America First" while leaving our people last. It means leading the world by example—strong, proud, and unshakable.**

This isn't left versus right. This isn't politics as usual. This is about building a system that actually works for the American people. A system built on American values, powered by American workers, and guided by American ingenuity.

## The Problem: The System Is Rigged Against Working Americans

For too long, we've watched the American Dream slip away while being told the economy is "booming." Wall Street soars while Main Street suffers. Hedge funds buy up our neighborhoods while families can't afford homes. Tech billionaires get richer while our data gets stolen. Meanwhile, our veterans sleep on streets while foreign investors own empty mansions.

The current approach isn't working because it treats symptoms, not causes. We need systemic solutions that address the root of our problems.

## Our Action Plan: The American Resilience Economy

Here's what we would do to truly make America great again:

### 1. Put Cash Directly in Every American's Pocket

**The Challenge:** Wages haven't kept up with costs. Working families are one emergency away from poverty.

**Our Solution: Launch the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) System**

This isn't just a handout—it's a smart, adaptive system that recognizes Americans are different and have different needs:

- **Universal Security Floor:** Every American gets a guaranteed basic income of $1,800/month that ensures no one who works hard falls into poverty. Period.
- **Adaptive Needs Support:** Additional support up to $600/month based on real circumstances: health challenges, caring for family members, living in expensive areas, supporting veterans with disabilities, or raising children.
- **Patriotic Hearts Currency:** Americans earn "American Hearts" for doing the essential work that makes our communities strong but Wall Street ignores: caring for children and elders, volunteering, mentoring, restoring local environments, supporting veterans. Hearts can be spent in the care economy and earn you up to an additional $400/month.
- **Merit Recognition:** Unlike welfare that punishes success, AUBI rewards contribution. The more you help your community, the more you earn—with no caps, no penalties, no bureaucratic traps.

**Why This Makes America Great:** This isn't one-size-fits-all government. It's a system that adapts to real American lives—supporting the veteran with PTSD differently than the single mom, differently than the rural farmer. We reward the real backbone of America—the people who care for each other and their communities. No more choosing between profit and patriotism.

**The Genius:** Unlike traditional welfare that creates dependency and punishes improvement, AUBI grows with you. Get healthier? Keep your support while earning Hearts for helping others do the same. Start a business? Your AUBI provides the safety net to take entrepreneurial risks. Care for aging parents? Get recognized and supported for it instead of being financially penalized.

### 2. End the Housing Crisis and Beat Wall Street Speculation

**The Challenge:** Hedge funds are buying up American neighborhoods, pricing out working families and veterans.

**Our Solution: Deploy the Hearthstone Protocol for Community Stewardship**

We'll create **Community Stewardship Trusts**—the ultimate weapon against Wall Street housing speculation:

- Communities can take land and housing off the speculative market
- Guarantees affordable homes for working families and veterans forever
- Puts local control back in American hands, not foreign investors
- Uses proven legal tools to ensure housing serves people, not profit

**Why This Makes America Great:** American families deserve to own their piece of the American Dream. No more watching our neighborhoods get bought up by distant hedge funds.

### 3. Make Our Communities Safe Through Smart Prevention

**The Challenge:** Crime is rising, communities are fragmenting, and we're spending billions on reactive approaches that don't work.

**Our Solution: Build Community Safety from the Ground Up with the Kintsugi Protocol**

Instead of just reacting to crime, we'll prevent it:

**Create the Ultimate American Safety Force:** Our veterans, with their unparalleled training and commitment to service, are the ideal candidates to become our nation's first **Community Safety Weavers**—respected community members who can de-escalate conflicts and respond to non-violent crises
- Address mental health and addiction as health issues, not criminal ones, through the **Cairn Protocol**
- Fund **Community Work Teams** through the Work in Liberation Framework to rebuild neighborhoods—fixing parks, maintaining infrastructure, creating beautiful public spaces
- Americans get paid in "Hearts" for making their communities stronger

**Why This Makes America Great:** We solve problems at the root, which is both more effective and cheaper than waiting for them to explode. Plus, Americans take ownership and pride in their communities.

### 4. Achieve True American Energy Independence

**The Challenge:** We're still dependent on volatile global energy markets and our infrastructure is vulnerable.

**Our Solution: Build the Ultimate American Energy Grid with the Conduit Protocol**

- Create a modern, resilient, unified American energy, water, and data grid
- Not just patching old systems—building world-class infrastructure that's secure from foreign threats and natural disasters
- Guarantee national resilience through American-controlled infrastructure commons
- Create millions of good-paying American jobs in the process

**Why This Makes America Great:** True independence means controlling our own destiny. No more being held hostage by foreign energy markets or vulnerable infrastructure.

### 5. End Food Waste and Secure Our Food Supply

**The Challenge:** We waste 40% of our food while families go hungry, and our food system is controlled by distant corporations.

**Our Solution: Launch American Food Independence Networks**

- Connect American farmers directly to communities, cutting out wasteful middlemen
- Ensure fresh, healthy food gets to families, not landfills
- Reward farmers with **"American Leaves"** for using regenerative practices that restore our soil
- Build resilient, local food networks that can't be disrupted by global supply chain chaos

**Why This Makes America Great:** American farmers feeding American families with American-grown food. Food security is national security.

### 6. Give Americans True Healthcare Freedom

**The Challenge:** Americans pay more for healthcare than anyone else in the world while getting worse results. Big Pharma and insurance company bureaucrats stand between Americans and their doctors, profiting from sickness instead of health.

**Our Solution: End Big Pharma's Stranglehold with the American Patriot Pharmaceutical Commons**

**Take Back Drug Manufacturing:** Launch the Prometheus Protocol to create an American-controlled pharmaceutical system. We'll use American R&D to develop life-saving medicines that are affordable for all Americans, not just the wealthy. No more being held hostage by foreign supply chains or price-gouging corporations.

**Invest in Health, Not Sickness:** Shift from a system that profits from keeping people sick to one that keeps Americans healthy. Integrate the best of modern medicine with proven prevention strategies. When Americans are healthier, they're more productive, more innovative, and stronger.

**Why This Makes America Great:** True freedom means the freedom to stay healthy without going bankrupt. When American families don't have to choose between medicine and groceries, when entrepreneurs don't stay trapped in corporate jobs for health insurance, that's when American innovation really takes off.

### 7. Unleash the Next Generation of American Innovators

**The Challenge:** Young Americans are drowning in student debt for degrees that don't lead to good jobs. Meanwhile, we have a massive skills gap in the trades and technology that actually build our country.

**Our Solution: Create American Life-Long Learning Accounts**

**End the Debt Trap:** Every American gets a learning account funded by our tax on AI and automation. Want to learn coding? Covered. Want to become an electrician? Covered. Want to start a business? We'll fund the skills you need. No more choosing between opportunity and debt.

**Reward Real Skills:** Connect learning to actual American jobs—the trades that build our infrastructure, the technology that secures our future, the care work that strengthens our communities. Students earn Hearts for community service projects while they learn.

**Why This Makes America Great:** When every American can develop their talents without going into debt, we create the most skilled and innovative workforce in the world. We're not just making college cheaper—we're making all Americans smarter and more capable.

### 8. End the Political Wars and Let the People Rule

**The Challenge:** Politicians in Washington from both parties bicker and accomplish nothing while real problems go unsolved. Americans are exhausted by the political circus and want leaders who actually solve problems.

**Our Solution: Bypass the Swamp with American Citizen Assemblies**

**Give Power Back to the People:** Create panels of randomly selected, everyday Americans to tackle our toughest challenges—immigration, infrastructure, the national debt. Not politicians, not lobbyists, not pundits—real people finding common-sense solutions.

**End the Partisan Gridlock:** When regular Americans sit down together, they find solutions. They don't need to win news cycles or raise money—they just need to solve problems. These assemblies become the blueprint for real policy that works.

**Why This Makes America Great:** This is the ultimate expression of "We the People." When Americans lead, America wins. When we bypass the corrupt system and let citizens govern directly, we get the country we actually want.

### 9. Lead the World, Don't Follow It

**The Challenge:** America gets dragged into bad deals and disrespected on the world stage.

**Our Solution: Rewrite the Rules Through American Leadership**

**End the UN Veto Stalemate:** We'll lead a coalition to reform the UN Security Council and end the absolute veto power that lets countries like China and Russia block action on critical issues.

**Create the Earth Defense Force:** Transform our military mission while maintaining defensive strength. Lead a new global force focused on shared threats no single nation can solve: asteroid defense, pandemic prevention, climate security. This demonstrates undeniable American leadership and turns adversaries into partners.

**Champion the Treaty for Our Only Home:** Set new, stronger standards for space, cyberspace, and global trade that put American interests and values first.

**Why This Makes America Great:** True strength isn't about withdrawing—it's about setting the agenda. When America leads on the challenges that matter, everyone else follows our rules.

## How We'd Pay for It: Make the System Work for America

**End Corporate Welfare that Ships Jobs Overseas:** Stop subsidies for companies that outsource American jobs.

**Make Tech Giants Pay Their Fair Share:** 15% American Worker Protection & Retraining Levy on AI and automation that replaces American workers, funding retraining and community investment. If they're going to automate away jobs, they pay to rebuild American communities.

**Close Wall Street Speculation Loopholes:** Financial transaction taxes on the high-frequency trading that destabilizes our economy while producing nothing of value.

**Smart Adaptation Saves Money:** Because AUBI adapts to real needs instead of one-size-fits-all bureaucracy, we eliminate massive administrative waste. Every dollar goes to Americans who need it, not government overhead.

**Result:** A system that invests in Americans instead of bailing out corporations. Instead of welfare that traps people, we get a platform that launches them.

## The Bottom Line

Making America great isn't about returning to the past. It's about building a future that is stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous for every single American.

This is our playbook for true national renewal. It fixes the system from the inside out and ensures America leads the world for the next century.

**The old playbook got us here. This new one will get us there.**

The question isn't whether America can be great again. The question is: Are we bold enough to build the greatness our country deserves?

This isn't just policy—it's the next chapter of the American story. A story where innovation serves communities, where strength protects prosperity, and where American leadership creates a world worth passing to our children.

**If we were Trump, this is how we would truly make America great again.**
