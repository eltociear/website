Come together human heart
Let's make a new fresh start
To a regenerative future
Inclusive for all creatures

Guided by both wisdom old,
And dreams the future dares to hold,
We weave the world with tender care,
A common home for all to share.

Where rivers speak and forests vote, 
And every voice finds sacred note, 
We birth the councils yet to come— 
Many centers, all as one.

We build a scaffold, strong and true, 
To hold the world while it is new, 
Then let it fall, no longer bound, 
On healthy, free, and sacred ground.
