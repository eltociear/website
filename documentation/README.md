# GGF Documentation Repository

Welcome to the working documentation for the Global Governance Frameworks project. This repository contains everything from strategic planning to AI collaboration notes — organized for transparency and collaboration.

## What's Here

### Development Resources

- **[`bioregional-homesteading/`](bioregional-homesteading/)** - Regional implementation templates (starting with Baltic region)
- **[`visualizations/`](visualizations/)** - Diagrams explaining core concepts (governance, economics, sovereignty)
- **[`assets/`](assets/)** - Brand materials, logos, social media graphics

### Transparent Process

- **[`ai-conversations/`](ai-conversations/)** - Notable exchanges with Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek showing development thinking
  - Not comprehensive logs (that would be overwhelming)
  - Selected conversations that reveal decision-making or address important questions
  - Organized by AI system and topic area

### Historical Archive

- **[`_archive/`](_archive/)** - Draft versions, early explorations, superseded approaches
  - Available for transparency and learning
  - Not required reading for contribution

## About AI-Assisted Development

This project has been developed since March 2025 with extensive AI collaboration (primarily Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek). This is disclosed openly because:

1. **Transparency matters** - You should know how frameworks were developed
2. **AI is a tool** - Like calculators for math, AIs help with systems thinking at scale
3. **Human judgment remains central** - All strategic decisions, ethical positions, and priorities are human-set
4. **The work is verifiable** - Frameworks stand or fall on their own merit

The `ai-conversations/` folder provides a history of this process.

## Documentation Standards

- **Bilingual where needed** - English primary, Swedish for local contexts
- **Version control** - Major documents track version numbers

## Project Context

**Started:** March 2025 
**Status:** Open-source collaboration phase (as of January 2026)  
**Readiness:** 33/300 on implementation index (need 150/300 by 2030)  
**Approach:** Radical transparency + iterative refinement + distributed collaboration

**Probability Assessment:** Most likely outcome is still collapse (~60-70%). These frameworks shift managed transition probability from ~4% to ~15-25%. Not hopium — salvage preparation.
