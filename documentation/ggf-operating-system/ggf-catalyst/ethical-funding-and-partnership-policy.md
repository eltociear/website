# The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst: Ethical Funding and Partnership Policy

Version: 1.0

Date: July 30, 2025

**Status**: Proposed for Board Adoption
## 1. Preamble: Funding as an Expression of "Right Relationship"

The Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) Catalyst is founded on the principle of fostering a sustainable global civilization through shared stewardship and "Right Relationship" (Statutes, § 3). Our funding and partnership strategy is a direct reflection of this core mission. We believe that the resources that fuel our work must be as clean as the world we aim to build.

This policy serves as a clear guide for the association's Board, operational teams, and global community. It ensures that every financial contribution and partnership strengthens our mission, protects our political and religious independence, and upholds our commitment to radical transparency. We seek relationships with partners who share our vision for a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future, not merely transactional funding.

## 2. Accepted Funding Sources (The "Green List")

The GGF Catalyst will actively seek and accept support from sources that are aligned with our mission and values. These include:

- **Individual Contributions**: We welcome grassroots financial support from our global community of members and supporters, primarily through transparent platforms like OpenCollective, in line with our principle of Radical Transparency (Statutes, § 13).
- **Membership Fees**: Annual fees as determined by the association's Annual Meeting (Statutes, § 6).
- **Aligned Philanthropic Foundations**: Grants from foundations and non-profit organizations whose missions are explicitly and demonstrably focused on systems change, open-source technology, peace and reconciliation, ecological regeneration, intersectional justice, or democratic innovation.
- **Public Funding (with strict conditions)**: Grants from democratic, public institutions (such as national innovation agencies or international development bodies) are acceptable only when the funding is unconditional, respects our political independence, and does not restrict our ability to license all work as open source (Statutes, § 13).
- **Mission-Aligned Earned Income**: Revenue generated from activities that directly advance our mission, such as:
  - Educational workshops on GGF principles and frameworks.
  - Advisory services to organizations seeking to implement regenerative governance models.
  - Support contracts for the open-source digital tools developed by the Tech Lab (Statutes, § 4).

## 3. Restricted and Prohibited Funding Sources (The "Red List")

To maintain our mission's integrity and untarnished reputation, the GGF Catalyst will not solicit or accept funding from organizations, corporations, or individuals whose core business practices are in fundamental conflict with our purpose.

### 3.1. Prohibited Industries and Actors:

Funding will be refused from any entity whose primary revenue is derived from:

- **Fossil Fuel Extraction**: The exploration, extraction, and production of oil, gas, and coal.
- **Weapons Manufacturing**: The design, manufacture, or sale of military weapons and armaments.
- **Tobacco Industry**: The production and sale of tobacco products.
- **Predatory Industries**: Activities such as predatory lending, industrial-scale gambling, or business models that rely on the exploitation of vulnerable populations.
- **Ecologically Destructive Practices**: Industries engaged in large-scale deforestation, industrial agriculture reliant on harmful pesticides, or other activities that result in ecocide.

### 3.2. Prohibited Governments and State-Owned Enterprises:

The association will not accept funding from governments, government agencies, or state-owned enterprises with documented, systemic records of:

- Significant human rights violations as determined by credible international bodies.
- The suppression of democracy and civil liberties.
- Actions that directly and actively undermine the GGF's core principles of peace, equity, and ecological stewardship.

### 3.3. Prohibited Funding Conditions:

The association will reject any donation, grant, or partnership that:

- Is conditional upon influencing our research, framework content, or policy positions.
- Restricts our commitment to Radical Transparency or Open Source Intellectual Property (Statutes, § 13).
- Requires exclusivity or compromises our ability to collaborate with other aligned partners.

- Comes from an anonymous source for any amount exceeding 5,000 SEK, to ensure public accountability.

## 4. Due Diligence and Review Process

The Board ("Support Guild," Statutes, § 7) holds the final responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy.

1. **Initial Screening**: All potential grants, partnerships, or individual donations exceeding 50,000 SEK will undergo an initial screening by the Treasurer and Chairperson against the "Red List" criteria.

2. **Board Review**: Any funding source that is not clearly on the "Green List" or raises potential conflicts must be presented to the full Board for review at the next scheduled meeting.

3. **Decision and Documentation**: The Board's decision to accept or reject the funding will be documented in the meeting minutes. The guiding question for all decisions will be: "Does this partnership enhance or endanger our mission and our community's trust?"

4. **Right of Refusal**: The Board reserves the absolute right to refuse or return any contribution, at its sole discretion, if it is determined to be inconsistent with the association's mission, values, or this policy.

This policy shall be reviewed annually by the Board to ensure it remains relevant and effective in safeguarding the mission of The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst.
