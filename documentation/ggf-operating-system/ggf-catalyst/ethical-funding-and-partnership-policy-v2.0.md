### **The Alchemy of Right Relationship: An Ethical Funding & Partnership Policy**

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** July 31, 2025
**Status:** Revised Draft for Board Adoption

#### **1. Preamble: The Alchemy of Relational Resources**

The Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) Catalyst is founded on the principle of "Right Relationship". We recognize that all resources are expressions of a unified web of life. No source is inherently "pure" or "impure," yet we must discern the relational effects of our partnerships.

This policy is our commitment to this discernment. Our funding choices arise not from moral judgment, but from clarity about which relationships empower our mission and which might perpetuate the very systems we seek to transform. We believe in the alchemical potential of redirecting energy toward collective healing. This policy therefore moves beyond a simple binary of "good" and "bad" funding to a nuanced practice of relational alignment and, where appropriate, conscious transmutation.

#### **2. Core Principles**

* **Discernment over Judgment:** We assess potential partnerships based on their alignment with our mission and their potential for transformation, not on moral condemnation of past actions.
* **Transformation over Purity:** We remain open to the possibility that resources from historically extractive sources can be redeemed through unconditional, transparent, and reparative giving.
* **Radical Transparency:** All funding sources and the rationale for their acceptance will be made public, upholding our community's trust and our statutory commitment to transparency.
* **Non-Attachment:** All funds are held lightly. We reserve the right to return any donation—with gratitude and without judgment—if its presence is found to compromise our mission's integrity.

#### **3. Aligned Funding Sources (The "Green Pathway")**

The GGF Catalyst will continue to actively seek and accept support from sources that are clearly and demonstrably aligned with our mission. This is our preferred and primary pathway for funding. These sources include:

* **Individual Contributions & Membership Fees**
* **Aligned Philanthropic Foundations** (focused on systems change, peace, ecological regeneration, etc.)
* **Public Funding** (unconditional and respecting our independence)
* **Mission-Aligned Earned Income** (workshops, advisory services, etc.)

#### **4. Transformational Funding Sources (The "Alchemical Pathway")**

This pathway is for sources whose core business practices have historically been in conflict with our mission. We remain open to accepting funds from these sources not as a simple donation, but as a committed act of **redemption and repair**.

##### **4.1. Industries Requiring the Alchemical Pathway:**
This pathway is required for any entity whose primary revenue is derived from industries such as: Fossil Fuel Extraction, Weapons Manufacturing, Tobacco, Predatory Finance, and Ecologically Destructive Practices.

##### **4.2. Conditions for Acceptance:**
Funding from these sources may only be accepted if **all** of the following criteria are met:

1.  **Irrevocably Unconditional:** The gift must have no conditions, explicit or implicit, that could influence our research, policies, or independence. The donor must publicly acknowledge the unconditional nature of the gift.
2.  **Radical Transparency:** The donor, the amount, and the Board's full rationale for acceptance must be made public on our OpenCollective page. Anonymous donations from these sources are not permitted.
3.  **Commitment to Redress (The Redemption Plan):** The funds must be allocated to projects that directly address and heal the systemic harm associated with the donor’s industry. A public "Redemption Plan" will be co-designed by the Board and relevant stakeholders.
4.  **Willingness to Engage in Dialogue:** While not mandatory, the donor is invited to participate in a public forum on reparative economics and the transition to regenerative models.

#### **5. The Due Diligence & Discernment Process**

The Board ("Support Guild") holds the final responsibility for all funding decisions. For any potential funding that falls under the "Alchemical Pathway," the following process is mandatory:

1.  **Initial Screening:** The Treasurer and Chairperson conduct an initial screening to ensure the four conditions for acceptance can be met.
2.  **The Discernment Ritual:** If the conditions are met, the proposal is brought to the full Board for a formal discernment process, which includes:
    * **The Witness:** A representative from a community impacted by the donor’s industry is invited to speak to the Board, sharing their perspective.
    * **The Mirror:** Board members engage in a guided reflection on the question: *"What part of ourselves and our systems are we projecting onto this donor?"*.
    * **The Koan:** The final vote is guided by the open question: *"Does this decision expand or contract the field of collective trust and our capacity to serve our mission?"*.
3.  **Decision:** Acceptance requires an 80% supermajority vote of the Board. The decision and its detailed rationale are documented and made public.

#### **6. Safeguards for Integrity & Trust**

To ensure this policy strengthens rather than compromises our mission, the following safeguards are in place:

* **Public Redemption Plans:** For every accepted "Alchemical Pathway" donation, a public plan detailing how the funds will be used for reparative action will be published.
* **Budgetary Cap:** Funds accepted through the Alchemical Pathway will be capped at a maximum of 20% of the association's total annual budget to avoid dependency.
* **The Non-Attachment Clause:** The GGF Catalyst reserves the absolute right to return any donation (with any accrued interest) if the donor's subsequent actions are found to be in gross violation of the GGF's principles or if the relationship is found to be a net harm to the mission.
* **The Bodhisattva Fund (Anonymous Redemption Pathway):** An anonymous fund will be established for donors from any background who wish to contribute without egoic attachment. Funds from this pool are allocated at the Board's discretion with the highest level of transparency.
