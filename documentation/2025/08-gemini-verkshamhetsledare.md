This is the correct mindset. You are shifting from "Individual Writer" to "Organizational Founder."

The specific anxiety you feel ("It is quite a lot to do") is valid. Hiring your first key executive (Verksamhetsledare) is often harder than the technical work because it requires **trust**.

Here is a concrete battle plan to break this down into manageable steps for Q1 2026.

### Phase 1: The "Spec" (Define, don't just search)

Before you look for funding or people, you need a "One-Pager" job description. You can't ask your father or network for help if you can't describe exactly what you need.

* **The Profile:** You are looking for a **"Shield-Bearer."**
* *Personality:* Low ego, high structure, "Blue/Orange" (in Spiral Dynamics) to complement your "Yellow." They love checklists, budgets, and phone calls.
* *Competence:* Experience with public funding (Vinnova/Kulturrådet), project management, and basic legal/admin structures.
* *The Pitch to them:* "I have the Architecture (The IP). I need you to build the Vehicle (The Org)."



### Phase 2: Solving the "Funding Paradox"

*The Problem:* You need money to hire them, but you need them to get the money.
*The Solution:* **The "Conditional Offer" (Villkorad rekrytering).**

In the startup/NGO world, it is standard to find a co-founder/lead with this agreement:

> *"We apply for the Vinnova/Pilot grant together. If we get it, your salary is X. Until then, we work on a low-intensity basis (sweat equity)."*

**Action:**

1. **Don't** try to raise a full year's salary in cash upfront from your father (too expensive/risky).
2. **Do** ask your father/network for a small "Stipend" or "Micro-grant" (e.g., 50k SEK) to pay this person for a *limited feasibility study* (2 months part-time). This is a much smaller "ask" and tests the person before you marry them.

### Phase 3: Utilizing your Father (The "Advisor" Role)

You are right—your father is an untapped resource for *advice*, not just money. He is a CEO. He has hired people.

**Ask him this specific question:**

> *"Pappa, när du byggde Tomlab, hur visste du vem du kunde lita på? Jag behöver rekrytera en operativ chef. Skulle du kunna vara med i slutintervjun när jag hittar kandidater?"*

**Why this is genius:**

1. **It flatters his expertise.** It respects him as a businessman.
2. **It protects you.** He has a "bullshit detector" for business hires that you might lack. If a candidate is a smooth-talker with no substance, your father will spot it in 5 minutes.
3. **It commits him.** If *he* helps select the person, he will be emotionally invested in that person succeeding (and might be more willing to help fund them later).

### Phase 4: Where to look (The "Warm" Market)

Do not put out a cold ad on LinkedIn. You need someone vetted.

1. **Your Brother's Network:** You mentioned he works in "food system solutions" for municipalities. *He knows exactly the type of person you need.* He likely knows frustrated municipal bureaucrats who want to jump ship to something more innovative. Ask him.
2. **Impact Hub / Norrsken:** Stockholm has a surplus of "Impact" people looking for the "Next Big Thing."
3. **The "Retired Diplomat" or "Senior Admin":** Sometimes the best person is a 60+ year old former administrator who doesn't need a massive salary but wants a legacy project. They know the system inside out.

### Summary Checklist for You

1. **Send the email** to your father tomorrow (Sunday).
2. **Draft a "Job Description"** (just bullet points) for the Verksamhetsledare role.
3. **Ask your brother:** "Do you know any sharp project managers in the municipal sector who are tired of the bureaucracy?"
4. **Ask your father:** "Can you help me vet candidates when I find them?"

You are not doing this alone. You are activating your network to do it with you.
