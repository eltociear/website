# Revisions to Baltic Bioregional Homesteading Template
## Summary of Changes (December 2025)

### Why We Revised

The original template assumed:
- ❌ You would be permanent coordinator
- ❌ GGF was established organization with funding
- ❌ You would run coordination activities (calls, etc.)

The revised version is:
- ✅ Open coordinator position (invitational)
- ✅ GGF as potential future framework only
- ✅ Self-organization by contributors
- ✅ Honest about being zero-budget, volunteer-driven

---

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Coordinator Role: From "Assigned" to "Open Position"

**Before:**
```
Coordination: Björn Kenneth Holmström (Global Governance Frameworks)
```

**After:**
```
Initial Creator: Björn Kenneth Holmström
Regional Coordinator: [OPEN POSITION - see below]
```

**Why:** 
- Invites local leadership rather than imposing external coordinator
- Makes clear this isn't your permanent role
- Signals you're looking for a partner, not building empire

---

### 2. Purpose: From "GGF Initiative" to "Volunteer Knowledge Sharing"

**Before:**
- Implicitly framed as part of larger organizational structure
- Assumed coordination infrastructure was the goal

**After:**
```
Current status: Volunteer-driven knowledge sharing. No organization, no budget, no bureaucracy.

Potential future: If this proves valuable, it could expand to economic coordination 
(bulk purchasing, tool sharing), integration with other bioregions, or formalization 
as a cooperative. But we're starting simple: just sharing what works.
```

**Why:**
- Reduces barrier to entry (people don't need to buy into GGF vision)
- More honest about current reality
- Lets the network evolve organically based on participant needs

---

### 3. Coordination Activities: From "Organized by Coordinator" to "Self-Organized"

**Before:**
```
Proposed: Monthly Coordination Calls
Starting February 2026 (tentative)
Format: 1-hour video call, rotating topics
Who: Open to all Baltic bioregion homesteaders
Sign up: Contact coordinator to express interest
```

**After:**
```
Self-Organization (Optional)

This document is just for knowledge sharing. But if contributors want to coordinate 
directly, you can:
- Organize video calls
- Regional gatherings
- Create Signal/WhatsApp groups
- Coordinate bulk seed orders, equipment sharing

How to organize:
- Any contributor can propose coordination activities
- Use the "Contributors" contact info to reach out
- Self-organizing—no permission needed
```

**Why:**
- Tests whether people actually want coordination or just knowledge base
- Prevents you from becoming bottleneck
- Proves self-organization principle central to GGF
- Reduces your time commitment

---

### 4. Added: Funding Section (Honest About Zero Budget)

**New section:**
```
## Funding & Sustainability

Current status: Volunteer-driven, zero-budget project.

Why no budget? Knowledge sharing doesn't require money.

Possible future funding (if network grows):
- Small participant contributions (optional)
- Grants for sustainable agriculture
- Integration with broader coordination frameworks

What funding would enable:
- Regional coordinator stipends (~$500-1000/month)
- Better platform
- In-person gatherings
- Bulk purchasing infrastructure

Timeline: 6-12 months if this takes off. But starting with zero budget to prove 
the model first.
```

**Why:**
- Manages expectations (no one expects paid positions immediately)
- Shows funding is possibility, not promise
- Explains why coordinator starts as volunteer
- Honest about what money would enable

---

### 5. Coordinator Job Description: More Detailed and Invitational

**Added to document:**
```
Regional Coordinator Role (Open Position)

This knowledge base needs someone to:
- Invite experienced Baltic homesteaders to contribute
- Maintain quality (peer validation of advice)
- Connect people who ask questions with people who have answers
- Decide when/if to migrate to better platform
- Facilitate (not run) coordination activities if there's interest

Time commitment:
- Initial: ~10 hours (recruit first contributors)
- Ongoing: ~2-5 hours/month

Currently volunteer. Potential for paid position if:
- Network grows to 50+ active participants
- Funding secured
- Estimated timeline: 6-12 months if this takes off

Why this role matters:
Hundreds of Baltic homesteaders are struggling alone. A coordinator helps 
prevent that waste. You're not "running things"—you're connecting people 
and maintaining infrastructure that enables self-organization.
```

**Why:**
- Clear what the role actually involves
- Realistic time estimates
- Honest about compensation timeline
- Appeals to mission (preventing isolated struggle)
- Emphasizes facilitation over control

---

### 6. GGF Framing: From "Organization" to "Possible Future Framework"

**Before:**
- Implicit that this was GGF project
- Suggested established infrastructure

**After:**
```
About broader coordination frameworks:
This knowledge base may eventually integrate with economic coordination tools 
(alternative currencies for skill exchange, commons governance for shared resources, 
cross-bioregional learning networks). But that's speculative future work. For now, 
this is just about connecting Baltic homesteaders so they stop struggling alone.
```

**Why:**
- Doesn't hide your larger vision (still mentions it)
- Frames it as possibility, not current reality
- Keeps focus on immediate, tangible value
- People can opt into larger vision if interested, but not required

---

## What These Changes Enable

### For Potential Coordinator (e.g., Estonian Homesteader):

**Before revision:**
- Feels like contributing to someone else's pre-defined project
- Unclear what GGF is or why it matters
- Coordinator role seems like doing your work for you

**After revision:**
- Invitation to co-create something new
- Clear ownership opportunity ("your regional network")
- Honest about current reality (no budget, no organization)
- Room to shape it based on actual needs

### For Contributors:

**Before:**
- Might feel like feeding someone's organizational agenda
- Unclear if this requires buying into broader vision

**After:**
- Just sharing knowledge with neighbors
- Self-organization optional, not required
- Can participate at whatever level makes sense

### For You:

**Before:**
- Positioned as permanent coordinator
- Would need to run calls, manage contributors
- 10-20 hours/month ongoing commitment

**After:**
- Looking for regional partner to hand off to
- Available for support but not operations
- 2-5 hours/month after handoff
- Frees you for other GGF priorities

## How to Use Revised Template

### Step 1: Create Google Doc
1. Copy revised template content
2. Add your actual email where indicated
3. Set sharing to "Anyone with link can view"

### Step 2: Post Comment on Estonian Homesteader's Video
Use the refined comment from our conversation.

### Step 3: If She Responds Positively

**Send the partnership invitation:**
- Frame as co-creating coordination infrastructure
- Offer regional coordinator role
- Clear about volunteer start, potential paid future
- Emphasize her ownership and leadership

**Key message:**
"I'm looking for someone to own this for the Baltic region—someone with credibility 
and experience who can invite contributors and facilitate connections. I'll provide 
technical support and systems architecture, but this should be *your* network, not 
my project that you contribute to."

### Step 4: If She Accepts

- Give her edit access to doc
- Ask her to recruit 2-3 initial contributors
- Offer to help with first coordination call if wanted
- Then step back—let her run it

### Step 5: If She Declines

- Ask for referral to someone else in Baltic network
- Or try different bioregion
- Or create doc and see if coordinator emerges organically

## Success Metrics (Revised)

**Phase 0 (Weeks 1-4):**
✅ Found one person willing to be regional coordinator
✅ They've invited 1-2 other contributors
✅ Basic structure established
❌ NOT you running everything

**Phase 1 (Months 2-3):**
✅ 3-5 active contributors
✅ Self-organized coordination happening (calls, bulk orders, etc.) OR clear that knowledge base alone is sufficient
✅ You're spending <5 hours/month on support
❌ NOT dependent on you for operations

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6):**
✅ 10-20 participants
✅ Documented case of knowledge preventing failure
✅ Coordinator managing quality and connections
✅ Decision made on platform (stay Google Doc or migrate to wiki)
❌ NOT you doing daily operations

**If these metrics hit, you've validated the model and can replicate in other bioregions.**

---

## Integration with Larger GGF Work

This revised approach **strengthens** rather than weakens GGF development:

### Validates Core Principles:
- ✅ Minimal coordination infrastructure enables self-organization
- ✅ People take ownership when given good tools + autonomy
- ✅ Bioregional structure makes more sense than global/generic
- ✅ Zero-budget prototype proves model before seeking funding

### Provides Concrete Examples:
- When pitching to funders: "Here's working example of bioregional coordination we built for $0"
- When approaching jurisdictions: "Here's network of 50 homesteaders already coordinating—imagine what policy support could enable"
- When recruiting team: "Here's proof the model works at small scale"

### Creates Pipeline for Larger Coordination:
- Hearts/Leaves currency pilot (2027) → launch in Baltic network first
- Commons Fund mechanisms → test with bulk purchasing coordination
- BAZ governance → formalize successful networks as cooperatives
- Cross-regional learning → connect Baltic coordinator with Pacific NW coordinator

### But Doesn't Depend on GGF:
- If GGF development stalls, Baltic network still has value
- If funding never materializes, coordinator still helping people
- If you pivot to different approach, this stands alone
- **This makes it more resilient, not less integrated**

---

## The Philosophical Shift

### From: "I'm building a system and need contributors"
### To: "I'm creating infrastructure for self-organization and looking for partners"

This is actually **more aligned** with GGF principles than original framing.

You're not building a new hierarchy with you at top.

You're building the **town square** and inviting people to **govern themselves**.

The Baltic knowledge base is the prototype for that principle at smallest viable scale.

If it works here (knowledge sharing among ~10-50 homesteaders), it validates the approach for:
- Municipal governance (thousands)
- Bioregional coordination (hundreds of thousands)
- Eventually: planetary frameworks (billions)

**The pattern is the same across scales: provide good infrastructure, enable self-organization, get out of the way.**

## Your Next Steps

1. ✅ Review revised template
2. ✅ Create Google Doc with your contact info
3. ✅ Post comment on Estonian homesteader video
4. ⏳ If positive response → send partnership invitation
5. ⏳ If she accepts → hand off coordinator role
6. ⏳ Provide support as needed, but don't run operations
7. ⏳ Document what works/doesn't work
8. ⏳ Replicate in other bioregions if successful

**Total time investment:** ~30 hours over 3 months if you find a coordinator.

**Result:** Working proof that bioregional coordination infrastructure enables self-organization.

**That's your demonstration project for 2026.**

**The revised template is ready. The strategy is clear. Post the comment.**

The salvage operation begins when you enable others to coordinate themselves.
