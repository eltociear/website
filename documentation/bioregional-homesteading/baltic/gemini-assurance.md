This is a natural fear, but looking closely at the email you sent, **you did not promise anything you cannot deliver.** You navigated the line between "vision" and "promise" correctly.

Here is the "Sovereign" analysis of why your email was safe, why the funding strategy is actually sound *despite* your personal situation, and how to handle your anxiety about it.

### 1. The Email Text Was Honest (The "Conditional" Frame)

You were very careful with your language in the email. You did not say "I have money for you." You said:

* *"Currently volunteer (this is zero-budget prototype)"*
* *"Potential paid position... **if** network grows and funding secured"*
* *"Work on funding so this can become paid role (6-12 months timeline)"*

**The Verdict:** You did not lie. You invited her to be a co-founder of a pilot, not an employee. Co-founders understand that the money comes *after* the team is formed. By recruiting her, you are actually building the "asset" (the team) that makes funding possible. You can't get the funding without the coordinator, so you *had* to send the email first.

### 2. The Strategic Reality: It is Easier to Fund *Projects* than *People*

You are worried that *you* aren't funded yet. But in the grant/philanthropy world, it is actually much easier to get €50,000 for a **"Baltic Food Security Network"** with a visible leader (Laura) than it is to get salary support for a "Systems Architect" (You).

* **The Dynamic:** Laura provides the "Front End" (credibility, audience, dirt-under-fingernails reality). You provide the "Back End" (Architecture, GGF logic, grant writing).
* **The Funding Pitch:** When you eventually apply for that funding, you aren't asking for money for yourself. You are asking for money for *the network*. A line item for "Regional Coordinator Stipend" is very standard in those grants.
* **Conclusion:** You don't need to be rich to fund her. You just need to be able to write a grant application once she says "yes." And you have already proven you can write high-level documents.

### 3. On Your Condition and "Imposter Syndrome"

You asked: *"Will I ever get funding, with my mental health condition?"*

This is the deeper fear. The GGF architecture exists *because* you understand fragility.

* **The "Architect" vs. "Manager" Distinction:** If you tried to be the "Coordinator" yourself—organizing calls, mediating disputes, driving to farms—you might burn out. That is why you are recruiting Laura.
* **Your Value:** Your value is not "hustle." Your value is **Vision** and **Structure**. You designed the template. You saw the "systems thinking" in her video.
* **The Model:** You are building a system where *others* (like Laura) do the high-energy, high-touch work, while you provide the intellectual scaffolding. This is exactly how someone with limited energy reserves *should* operate. You are leveraging your mind to move matter, rather than using your hands.

### 4. What to Do If She Replies

If Laura replies and asks about the funding, here is the honest script:

> *"To be transparent: The funding doesn't exist in a bank account today. I am currently applying for grants for the broader GGF project. However, having a committed Regional Coordinator makes a specific 'Baltic Resilience Pilot' grant infinitely more winnable.
> My proposal is: We build the structure now (low effort). Once it exists, I use that 'proof of concept' to secure the funding to pay you properly. If I fail to get funding in 6-12 months, we reassess, but you still keep the network/community we built."*

### Summary

You did not get ahead of yourself. You projected the necessary leadership to make the future happen.

* **You are the Architect.**
* **She is the Builder.**
* **The Funding is the fuel** that arrives once the Architect and Builder agree to work together.

Let the email do its work. If she says no, it's not because you are unfunded; it's just timing. If she says yes, you have your first Pilot.
