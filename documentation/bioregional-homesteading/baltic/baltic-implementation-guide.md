*Subject: Baltic Homesteading Knowledge Base - Invitation to Contribute*

Hi [her name],

Thank you for being open to exploring coordination infrastructure! I've created a first draft of what a bioregional knowledge base could look like for the Baltic region.

**Here's the Google Doc:** [link]

It's currently empty except for the structure - think of it as a template waiting for people like you who've done the actual work.

**What I'm proposing:**

1. You (and 2-3 other experienced Baltic homesteaders) become founding contributors
2. Each person documents what they've learned in their specific country section
3. Be honest about timelines, costs, failures - not just the Instagram-perfect moments
4. The goal: prevent others from struggling alone the way so many currently do

**Time investment for you:**
- Initial: ~3-5 hours to document your 5-year journey
  - What works in Estonian climate/soil
  - What failed and why
  - Realistic timelines
  - Resources you wish you'd known about
- Ongoing: Maybe 1-2 hours every few months to update

**What you'd get in return:**
- Access to knowledge from other Baltic homesteaders as they contribute
- Connection to a network of practitioners (not just viewers)
- Optional: If you and other contributors want to coordinate directly (calls, gatherings, bulk purchases), this doc includes a directory to connect you. Self-organized, not run by me.
- Your name/contact if you want to mentor others (totally optional)

**No pressure at all.** I know you're busy with actual homesteading. But if this resonates, I think you could help build something really valuable.

Let me know what you think!

Björn

## Phase 0 Success Criteria

**You'll know this is working if:**

Within 2-4 weeks:
- ✅ 1-3 contributors have added substantive content
- ✅ At least one person has reached out saying "This helped me avoid a mistake"
- ✅ Contributors are engaging with each other (asking questions, adding to each other's sections)

**If yes → proceed to Phase 1 (monthly calls, formalize structure)**

**If no after 4 weeks:**
- Re-evaluate: Was this the right first contributor? Right bioregion? Right format?
- Pivot: Maybe try different region or different entry point
- Don't force it: If there's no organic interest, the model needs adjustment

## Finding Additional Contributors

**Where to look:**

1. **YouTube Comments**
   - Estonian homesteader's other videos
   - Similar Baltic homesteading channels
   - Look for people posting detailed, thoughtful comments about their experience

2. **Facebook Groups**
   - Search: "Estonia homesteading", "Latvia permaculture", "Lithuania self-sufficient"
   - Join, lurk, identify experienced practitioners
   - Reach out with personal invitation (not spam)

3. **Instagram/TikTok**
   - #EstonianHomestead, #BalticGardening, etc.
   - Look for actual documentation (not aspirational/aesthetic)
   - Contact creators with substantial following

4. **Local Organizations**
   - Estonian Permaculture Association (if exists)
   - Biodynamic farming groups
   - Community land trusts

**Invitation template:**

"Hi [name], I came across your [video/post/comment] about [specific homesteading thing]. I'm building a peer-validated knowledge base for Baltic homesteaders - people who've actually done the work sharing what actually works in our specific climate/soil. Would you be interested in contributing your experience? Here's what it looks like: [link]"

## Phase 1: Formalize (If Phase 0 Validates)

### Timeline: February-March 2026

**Actions:**

1. **Migrate to Better Platform** (if Google Doc gets unwieldy)
   - Option A: Keep Google Doc if it's working
   - Option B: Migrate to BookStack (self-hosted wiki) - $20/month
   - Option C: Notion (prettier, easier collaboration) - $8/month

2. **Launch Monthly Coordination Call**
   - First call: Late February
   - Agenda: Introductions, share what's working, identify coordination opportunities
   - Platform: Zoom (free tier works for <40min calls)
   - Frequency: Monthly, same day/time

3. **Establish Contribution Guidelines**
   - Quality standards (verified by experience, not speculation)
   - Moderation policy (remove spam, maintain focus)
   - Credit system (contributors acknowledged)

4. **Document Early Success**
   - Case study: "From Isolated Homesteaders to Functional Network in 60 Days"
   - Metrics: How many contributors, what problems solved, what value created
   - Share publicly: Blog post, video, presentation

## Phase 2: Scale (If Phase 1 Works)

### Timeline: Q2-Q3 2026

**Expand to Other Bioregions:**

- Maritime Canada (Atlantic provinces)
- Pacific Northwest (BC, Washington, Oregon)
- Nordic (Norway, Sweden, Finland)
- Central Europe (Germany, Poland)

**For each region:**
- Find 1-2 founding contributors
- Replicate the template structure
- Launch regional coordination calls
- Cross-pollinate learning

**Hire Regional Coordinators:**
- Each bioregion has paid coordinator (~$500-1000/month stipend)
- Responsibilities: facilitate calls, maintain wiki, connect people
- Funded by: Small contributions from participants + grants + your budget

## Integration with Larger GGF Work

**This bioregional knowledge base becomes:**

### A. Proof of Concept
- Demonstrates: Minimal coordination infrastructure creates massive value
- Shows: People will self-organize if given basic tools
- Proves: Bioregional structure works better than generic/global

### B. Foundation for Economic Coordination
- **2027:** Pilot Hearts/Leaves currency in Baltic network
  - Skill exchange ("I'll help you build greenhouse, you teach me fermentation")
  - Care work valuation (babysitting, elder care, animal care during travel)
  - Resource sharing (equipment rentals, bulk purchases)

### C. Community Land Trust Prototype
- **2027-2028:** If network grows to 50+ homesteads in region
- Formalize as legal cooperative
- Shared ownership of processing equipment, storage facilities
- This becomes a **micro-BAZ** - bioregional governance at community scale

### D. Demonstration for Policy Makers
- **2028:** When approaching Estonian government or EU officials
- You have working example: "Here's 100 homesteaders coordinating bioregionally, here's the documented value created, here's how minimal policy support could scale this"

## Budget & Resource Requirements

**Phase 0 (Test):**
- Time: 10-15 hours (template creation, initial outreach)
- Money: $0 (Google Docs free tier)

**Phase 1 (Formalize):**
- Time: 5-10 hours/month (facilitation, moderation, calls)
- Money: $50-100/month (video platform if >40min calls, possible wiki hosting)

**Phase 2 (Scale to 5 bioregions):**
- Time: 15-20 hours/month OR hire coordinator
- Money: $500-2000/month (regional coordinator stipends, platform costs)

**Phase 3 (Economic coordination):**
- Time: Part of core GGF work (Hearts/Leaves pilot)
- Money: Integrated with larger budget

## Metrics to Track

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Number of active contributors
- Sections filled vs. empty
- Comments/questions asked
- People reporting they used the knowledge

**Coordination Metrics:**
- Number of direct connections made (Person A helped Person B)
- Resources shared (seeds, tools, knowledge)
- Bulk purchases coordinated
- Failures prevented (documented cases)

**Economic Metrics:**
- Estimated value created (hours saved, mistakes prevented, resources shared)
- Cost to operate
- ROI calculation (value created / cost)

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- Testimonials ("This prevented me from wasting 2 years on X")
- Community cohesion (do people feel less alone?)
- Knowledge quality (is it actually useful?)

## Risk Mitigation

**What Could Go Wrong:**

1. **No one contributes**
   - Mitigation: Start with 1-2 enthusiastic people, build from there
   - Fallback: Pivot to different bioregion or format

2. **Quality control issues** (bad advice, spam)
   - Mitigation: Peer validation requirement, active moderation
   - Fallback: Closed contributor model (invitation only)

3. **Platform limitations** (Google Docs gets unwieldy)
   - Mitigation: Migrate to wiki when needed
   - Already planned in Phase 1

4. **Time drain on you**
   - Mitigation: Find co-coordinator early, set time boundaries
   - Hire regional coordinators as soon as budget allows

5. **Scope creep** (trying to cover too much)
   - Mitigation: Stay laser-focused on Baltic bioregion first
   - Only expand after demonstrating success

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

### This Week:
1. ✅ Create Google Doc from template
2. ✅ Customize with your contact info
3. ✅ Post comment on Estonian homesteader's video
4. ⏳ Wait for response

### If Positive Response (Next Week):
1. Send her invitation message (template above)
2. Identify 1-2 other potential Baltic contributors
3. Set deadline: "Goal is 3 contributors by end of January"

### February 2026:
1. If 3+ contributors engaged → announce monthly call
2. Document early learnings
3. Refine structure based on what's working

### March 2026:
1. Decide: Keep Google Doc or migrate to wiki?
2. Write case study of first 90 days
3. Begin planning expansion to second bioregion

## Integration with Your Other Work

**This coordinates with:**

- **Team building (Q1):** Legal architect and technical lead can help formalize structure
- **Technical prototypes:** Hearts/Leaves pilot launches in this network first
- **Funding strategy:** This is a cheap, fast demonstration you can show funders
- **Pilot jurisdiction outreach:** "Here's what we've already built bottom-up in Estonia"

**Time allocation:**
- Week 1: 10 hours (setup)
- Weeks 2-4: 2-3 hours/week (responding to contributors, facilitation)
- Month 2+: 5 hours/month (ongoing coordination)

**This is sustainable alongside your other priorities.**

## The Long View

**By December 2026, you could have:**
- 50-100 active homesteaders in Baltic network
- Documented knowledge preventing dozens of failures
- Monthly coordination calls building real community
- Hearts/Leaves currency pilot in testing
- Proof of concept for bioregional coordination

**By 2028:**
- 5 bioregional networks operational
- 200-500 participants globally
- Formalized as cooperatives/land trusts
- First micro-BAZ governance structure functioning

**By 2030:**
- When crisis hits, these networks are **operational resilience infrastructure**
- Municipalities partner with existing networks rather than building from scratch
- Your "demonstration project" is already saving lives

**This is the salvage operation at human scale.**

**The template is ready. Post your comment. Start building.**

The thermodynamics are running, but the Baltic homesteaders don't need to wait for the crash.

They can start coordinating Monday.
