## 🌍 Purpose of This Document

This is a **living knowledge base** created by and for homesteaders in the Baltic bioregion. 

**What makes this different from generic permaculture resources:**
- ✅ **Bioregionally specific** - focused on what works *here* in Baltic climate/soil
- ✅ **Peer-validated** - contributed by people with real experience
- ✅ **Failure-inclusive** - we document what doesn't work, not just successes
- ✅ **Timeline-realistic** - honest about how long things actually take
- ✅ **Coordination-enabled** - connects you with experienced practitioners

**Current status:** Volunteer-driven knowledge sharing. No organization, no budget, no bureaucracy.

**Potential future:** If this proves valuable, it could expand to economic coordination (bulk purchasing, tool sharing), integration with other bioregions, or formalization as a cooperative. But we're starting simple: just sharing what works.

**How to use this:**
1. Find your country section (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania)
2. Read what experienced homesteaders have learned
3. Contact contributors if you have specific questions
4. **Add your own learnings** as you gain experience

**How to contribute:**
- Request edit access from the coordinator
- Add your experiences to the relevant sections
- Be honest about failures and challenges
- Include timelines (Year 1, Year 3, Year 5, etc.)
- Optional: Add your contact info if you're willing to mentor others

### Community & Support

#### Self-Organization (Optional)

This document is just for knowledge sharing. But if contributors want to coordinate directly, you can:

**Possible activities:**
- Organize video calls (share learnings, troubleshoot, plan bulk purchases)
- Regional gatherings (if geographically feasible)
- Create Signal/WhatsApp groups for quick questions
- Coordinate bulk seed orders, equipment sharing

**How to organize:**
- Any contributor can propose coordination activities
- Use the "Contributors" contact info to reach out
- Self-organizing—no permission needed
- Share learnings back to this doc

**Simple call template** (if someone wants to start monthly calls):
1. Introductions (5 min)
2. What's working this season (20 min)
3. Challenges/questions (20 min)
4. Coordination opportunities (bulk orders, tool sharing) (10 min)
5. Next month's topic (5 min)

#### Online Resources
- [Facebook groups, forums specific to Baltic homesteading - to be added by contributors]
- [Language: Estonian/Latvian/Lithuanian vs. English resources]

#### Regional Coordinator Role (Open Position)

**This knowledge base needs someone to:**
- Invite experienced Baltic homesteaders to contribute
- Maintain quality (peer validation of advice)
- Connect people who ask questions with people who have answers
- Decide when/if to migrate to better platform (wiki, etc.)
- Facilitate (not run) coordination activities if there's interest

**Time commitment:**
- Initial: ~10 hours (recruit first contributors, set up structure)
- Ongoing: ~2-5 hours/month (respond to questions, connect people, maintain quality)

**Currently volunteer. Potential for paid position if:**
- Network grows to 50+ active participants
- Funding secured through grants or participant contributions
- Estimated timeline: 6-12 months if this takes off

**Interested?** Contact: [coordinator email below]

**Why this role matters:**
Right now, hundreds of Baltic homesteaders are struggling alone—figuring out through trial and error what others already know. A coordinator helps prevent that waste. You're not "running things"—you're connecting people and maintaining infrastructure that enables self-organization.

## 📞 Coordination & Contact

**Initial Creator:** Björn Kenneth Holmström  
**Email:** bjorn.kenneth.holmstrom@gmail.com  
**Role:** Created initial template and structure. Available for technical support (wiki setup, etc.) and questions about broader coordination frameworks.

**Regional Coordinator:** [OPEN POSITION]  
**To apply:** Email above with brief note about your homesteading experience and interest in coordinating this network.

**Purpose of coordinator role:**
- Invite and connect Baltic homesteaders
- Maintain document quality (peer validation)
- Help contributors self-organize (calls, gatherings, bulk purchases)
- Decide when/if to migrate to better platform
- Be the "go-to person" for Baltic bioregional homesteading questions

**Not required:**
- Running everything (this should be self-organizing)
- Technical skills (creator provides platform support)
- Lots of time (2-5 hours/month after initial setup)

**What's in it for coordinator:**
- Leadership of potentially important network
- First to benefit from coordination (bulk purchases, knowledge sharing, mutual aid)
- Potential paid role if network grows and funding secured
- Connection to broader resilience frameworks being developed

**About broader coordination frameworks:**
This knowledge base may eventually integrate with economic coordination tools (alternative currencies for skill exchange, commons governance for shared resources, cross-bioregional learning networks). But that's speculative future work. For now, this is just about connecting Baltic homesteaders so they stop struggling alone.

**This is a living document.** Last updated [date]. No fixed update schedule—evolves as contributors add knowledge.

**Future platform:** Starting with Google Docs for simplicity. If this proves valuable and gets unwieldy, coordinator can decide to migrate to wiki (BookStack, MediaWiki, etc.). Creator will provide technical support for migration.

## 💰 Funding & Sustainability

**Current status:** Volunteer-driven, zero-budget project. Free to use, free to contribute.

**Why no budget?**
Knowledge sharing doesn't require money. Google Docs is free. Coordination can be self-organized.

**Possible future funding (if network grows):**
- Small participant contributions (optional, only if members see value)
- Grants for sustainable agriculture / community resilience
- Integration with broader coordination frameworks (if those develop funding)

**What funding would enable:**
- Regional coordinator stipends (~$500-1000/month)
- Better platform (dedicated wiki instead of Google Docs)
- In-person regional gatherings
- Bulk purchasing coordination infrastructure
- Tool/equipment sharing systems
- Cross-bioregional learning programs

**Timeline:** If this takes off, funding might be secured 6-12 months out. But we're starting with zero budget to prove the model works first.

**Philosophy:** The knowledge itself should always be freely accessible. Funding would support coordination infrastructure, not gate-keep information.
