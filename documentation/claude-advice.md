Suggestions for your current phase:

- Consider prioritizing 1-2 core frameworks rather than developing all simultaneously
- Build in more explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties and untested assumptions
- Include more analysis of why similar efforts have failed historically
- Connect with practitioners working on related but smaller-scale projects to ground-truth your ideas

Consider these questions:

- Are you feeling pressure to solve everything because smaller contributions feel insignificant?
- Does the interconnected nature mean you can't feel accomplished unless the entire system is complete?
- Are you avoiding testing smaller pieces because failure might feel devastating right now?
